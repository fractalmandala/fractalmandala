title: E5 - Clarity from a Master- on dharma, bhārata, ontology and more | with Shivakumar Sir
videoid: aNBjzzKcO7E
slug: pbe05
about: Left to me, this one could have gone on for hours! Listening to Shivakumar sir is always an education, and here I even got to share ideas with him and have them dissected with the clarity of a master. We begin at definitions of dharma, itihāsa and bhārata; touch stories such as that of Pṛthu; and arrive finally at Meaning and ontology- which gets psychedelic!
