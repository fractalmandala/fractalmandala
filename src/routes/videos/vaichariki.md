about: Sri Aurobindo commented in detail about “exclusive preoccupation with the naturalistic element” of Rig Vedic hymns by the European scholars. They created a gulf between early Rigvedic age and later Upanishadic and other thoughts. Sri Aurobindo remarked “The hypothesis, invented to fill the gap, that these ideas were borrowed by barbarous Aryan invaders from the civilised Dravidians, is a conjecture supported only by other conjectures. It is indeed coming to be doubted whether the whole story of an Aryan invasion through the Punjab is not a myth of the philologists.” He revealed the secret of the Vedas as the embodiment of spiritual and psychological knowledge concealed “in a veil of concrete and material figures and symbols”. His seminal works laid a new foundation for a wide range of studies like Comparative Religion, Philology, Historiography, Mythology, Archaeology etc. Vaicārikī is an initiative for thoughts, dialogues and discussions as part of the 150th birth anniversary celebration of Sri Aurobindo. The fifth chapter titled “Aryas, Vedas and Historical Chronology” starts with a keynote address followed by a panel discussion.
