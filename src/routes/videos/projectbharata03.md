about: What is the Indian Civilisation? What is our model of Reality? In this video with Kiran, we conceive of Bhārata as an Infinite Lotus, a Fractal Maṇḍala. Along the way, we cover ideas on history, how we need to approach it, and the value to take from our literature. We also discuss the bedrock - the Bhāratīya conception of Dharma and Ṛta.
