	<h3 class="bord-bot p-bot-16">Javascript</h3>
	<p>
		Javascript- don't know it, not sure if doing it right, stumbling through mostly with chatGPT generated code, liking whatever little I understand of Typescript!
	</p>
	<p>
		As is true with any programming language, I understand best when there is a real and practical use-case I have- and it's in application of code for that use-case that I stand a chance of getting it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, though my codebase is replete with async functions, API fetches and toggles and mounts of all kinds, I couldn't really tell you the basics for most of it.
