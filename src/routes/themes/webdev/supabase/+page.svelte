	<p>
		I <b>absolutely</b> love Supabase. How can anyone not! And for me it came at absolutely the right time as exactly what I needed/was looking for.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I was looking for was a database platform where I could upload data via csv, which could then be operated on using SQL or PostgreSQL, and which could function as a back-end to feed an entire website. Supabase is an delightful delivery of all three.
	</p>
	<p>
		They've got several integrations, making it possible to use it with a variety of tools and frameworks. As of right now I'm using it as the back-end for my organization's 2 websites, and it is powering development of my Bá¹›hat Open Library project.
	</p>
	<h5>
		To top it all, their entry-level tier is free, and has enough to offer for any small-scale project.
	</h5>
	<p class="bord-top p-top-32">
		To get started on the platform, their own documents are the most useful. I also found some YouTube videos helpful in figuring the integration with frameworks like Next.js or Sveltekit.
