		About
	</h3>
	<p>Hi,</p>
	<p>
		I'm Amrit, a writer and creator based in Gurgaon, India. With a decade+ background in management and product development, I currently work as Director of Strategy at <a href="https://www.brhat.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bṛhat</a>, a cultural content, research and learning organization. Apart from this site, I also develop and maintain Bṛhat's website and the sister portal <a href="https://www.brhateducation.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bṛhat Education.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Through <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> wonderful knowledge repository I discovered the world of digital gardens, and this website is my attempt at building something similar. I have the dubious record of having killed any plant I've ever tried to grow, so hopefully the digital seeds I sow here stand a better chance!
	</p>
	<p>
		The Fractal Maṇḍala is a digital garden to chronicle what I learn and build. I develop web products, create historical fiction worlds, dabble in psytrance production and write essays on Indian history and civilizational consciousness. Beginning 2023, I have been scaffolding my way in web-dev using a range of online tutorials, and a healthy usage of chatGPT. I'm loving Sveltekit, and that's my select framework for this site. I haven't really tried SCSS, but I use original SASS because I like not having to use curly braces.
