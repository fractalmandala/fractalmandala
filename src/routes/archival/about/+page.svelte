	<p>Hi,</p>
	<p>
		I'm Amrit, a writer and creator based in Gurgaon, India. With a decade+ background in management and product development, I currently work as Director of Strategy at <a href="https://www.brhat.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bṛhat</a>, a cultural content, research and learning organization. Apart from this site, I also develop and maintain Bṛhat's website and the sister portal <a href="https://www.brhateducation.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bṛhat Education.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Through <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> wonderful knowledge repository I discovered the world of digital gardens, and this website is my attempt at building something similar. I have the dubious record of having killed any plant I've ever tried to grow, so hopefully the digital seeds I sow here stand a better chance!
	</p>
	<p>
		In this archival section I've gathered together some of the stuff I've created/written in what now feels like the ancient past.

		The best way to reach me is at <a href="https://twitter.com/saamaanyafreaky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter,</a> where I'm found as @saamaanyafreaky.
