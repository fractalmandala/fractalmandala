Tradition remembers Hiraṇyakaśipu as a ‘triloka cakravartin’ or ruler of three realms. The realms are symbolic, they represent a conception of Svarga, Prithvī and Pātāla that emerged in later times. It’s also possible they represent a geographical notion where Svarga was north of Meru, Prithvī was from Meru to the Gangetic Plains, and Pātāla south/southeast of that (with access corridors from the eastern Himālaya). ‘Conquest’ over such a vast territory in ~9000 BC could have, at best, meant a loose network of cultural, marital and commercial contracts which allowed for peaceful passage of an assortment of tribes in the said ‘kingdom.’ We are told that Hiraṇyakaśipu manages to put together such a kingdom, also bringing under submission his Āditya cousins.

Having established the kingdom he proceeds to ban the Āditya religion, especially practices favoured by Viṣṇu. This is an era of constant hostilities, and for a while his wife Kayādhū is abducted by Indra before being returned to him. Wife-abduction, as we will see, is a recurrent theme in Indian history. In this early instance however, there’s no hint of Hiraṇyakaśipu doubting the fatherhood of Kayādhū’s child. The son born is named Prahlāda, and to Hiraṇyakaśipu’s dismay he turns to the Āditya religion. Though incensed, at no point does Hiraṇyakaśipu wonder whether the child is someone else’s, which tells us that concerns of paternal ownership have not yet emerged. This is remarkably in line with what Harari portrays of early human societies in his book, Sapiens.

Viṣṇu was a major Hindu deity by the time the Purāṇas were composed, and so the historical Viṣṇu(s) and the mythological Mahāviṣṇu are often conflated. It’s evident through early Indian history that the Daityas and Ādityas were not ethnically or inherently different people. They constantly adopt each other’s religions, indulge in acts of co-operation, and mate with each other. Even basic institutions of marriage and child-ownership are absent. When mythology tells us of Prahlāda’s great devotion to Mahāviṣṇu and Hiraṇyakaśipu’s equal resistance to it, we are being given hints of a prince defying the religious and cultural sanctions of the king. It’s also likely that the accounts of Hiraṇyakaśipu’s many attempts to kill Prahlāda, and Mahāviṣṇu’s miraculous deeds to save him, are mythologised remains of father vs. son battles where the latter was aided by Ādityas eager to dethrone the king (where king is being used in a very loose sense).

Śukra Bhārgava plays a critical role in this tale. When Prahlāda first professes faith in Mahāviṣṇu, Hiraṇyakaśipu is inclined to blame the teacher Śukra. But Prahlāda’s faith appears inborn, and a dialogue between him and his father resembles a classic atheistic debate. On being told by Prahlāda that Mahāviṣṇu is omnipresent, Hiraṇyakaśipu furiously strikes a pillar and demands to be shown that the lord is indeed present in a pillar as well (which incidentally births the next avatāra). Śukra initially disclaims responsibility for Prahlāda’s faith, then tries to convert him, and eventually joins Hiraṇyakaśipu’s attempts to damage him. There’s no Bṛhaspati associated with Ādityas at this stage, so we may speculate that the magician-shaman order originated among Daityas. This of course makes sense. Fire is already sacred to people in the Mesolithic but they’re far from extracting aṅgāra-rasa.

This culminates in the second great Deva-Asura war, also remembered as the Narasiṁhāvatāra where Mahāviṣṇu incarnates as a half man-half lion and literally tears Hiraṇyakaśipu apart- an indication perhaps of how gory, visceral and intense Mesolithic battles might have been. Paurāṇika traditions remember twelve great Deva-Asura wars, of which the first two have already been visited:

1. Narasiṁhāvatāra vs. Hiraṇyakaśipu
2. Varāhāvatāra vs. Hiraṇyākṣa
3. Vāmanāvatāra vs. Bali
4. Amṛtamanthana War
5. Tārakāmaya War
6. Ādibaka War
7. Traipura War
8. Andhaka War
9. Vṛtrāsura vs. Indra
10. Dhvaja War
11. Hālāhala War
12. Rājeya War

A detailed study of these wars reveals that they cover three broad eras or generations, and not all twelve are to be taken as historical wars. Rather, the list represents what’s remembered of a few millennia of Daitya-Āditya rivalry, which even to the Vedic Indians was mythological enough to deify figures from. It was a period of amoral blood and conflict where semi-nomadic tribes vied for supremacy and order. In the first generation the conflicts were seeded by the Daitya brothers Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, and mythology suggests to us that these were leaders who abused their power and faced the rebellion of their kinsmen. But they were not the only ones doing so. Trouble was also being caused by Indra, the great Gordian knot of Indian mythology.
