After Māndhātṛ we enter a brief period of ambiguity. Synchronisms confuse more than resolve matters, evident in the case of Sivi Auśinara, born in the Ānava line. He’s placed at generation 26, three centuries after the reign of Māndhātṛ Aikṣvāku. For one, it’s clear from the literature that there were multiple Sivis and multiple Auśinaras (descendants of Uśinara). Sivi itself is an epithet for all of Sivi’s descendants, and without sharp discernment it’s impossible to know which individual is being talked about at any given time. Further, while Sivi does feature in the list of cakravartins, the stories available to us are mostly examples of his deep virtue, piety and high moral standing- again a reiteration of the Paurāṇika lens of history. We do know that there was an original Sivi, son of Uśinara, and that he and his descendants were responsible for Ānava settlement of the greater Punjab region. Happily for us, this settlement coincides with the Ravi phase of SSC in the same geography where Sivi and his descendants are placed. We could begin with assessing the geo-political scenarios of his time, and remember that Sivi is born in a dynasty that faced major defeat three centuries ago.

The Ānavas go into a relative decline post Māndhātṛ’s campaign. The name Mahāsala comes in genealogies as Janamejaya’s descendant, and Mahāmānasa as Mahāsala’s. This Mahāmānasa has two sons, and the line of Titikṣu the younger will later appear to us as the Aṅga kings in modern Bihar. It’s unclear what leads to this migration, and since it occurs a few generations after Māndhātṛ we cannot ascribe his campaign as the immediate trigger. But Paurāṇika and Vedic traditions are near silent on Titikṣu, and only later do we see his line appear again. One possibility is that Titikṣu’s migration was triggered by the actions of his brother, Uśinara’s elder son- Sivi.

Fragmentation after Māndhātṛ’s campaign has allowed the Ānavas, among others, to regroup. Once again they are in control of the greater Punjab area, and with the Pūrus in disarray to their near south-east in Haryana it’s not implausible for an ambitious monarch to see opportunity. Since direct stories of Sivi’s conquests are not available to us, these could as easily be ascribed to his sons and descendants. He is attributed however as the founder of a city in his name- Sivipuri. There’s no clear indication of it, but both the location and the chronology of Sivipuri are remarkably close to Harappa, where the earliest archaeological layers date to 3500-3300 BC. Both cities are also located along the Irāvatī river, and a parallel city of Harappa’s size and location has not been found. Sivi’s descendants are also collectively called Saivyas, and many of them established kingdoms of their own across the Sindhu. One son named Savīra migrated downstream and established Sauvīra in modern Sindh. The sons Kekaya and Madra established kingdoms in modern Punjab, their descendants featuring both in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.

This Ānava expansion would put them where the Druhyus hitherto lived, causing a further westward migration of the latter. Paurāṇika tradition says that a descendant of Aṅgāra, the Druhyu defeated by Māndhātṛ, established the kingdom of Gāndhāra. We should avoid the temptation to place this squarely at modern Kandahar, for the name travelled west as the Druhyus migrated over several centuries. In Sivi’s era we should still place them in modern Pakistan, the region part of Gāndhāra of that era. These conflicts and the Ānava expansion can directly be mapped to the dispersal of the European branches of IE families, and their journey through the Druhyus will be detailed in Chapter 6. Some of Sivi’s likely contemporaries are Aṣṭavartha of the Kāśī kingdom and Haryaśva of the Aikṣvākus. But here too the tales only tell of Sivi’s moral standing. The story goes that at Aṣṭavartha’s aśvamedha the gods appear to declare that of all the kings gathered, only Sivi is worthy of attaining svarga, or heaven.

Another story about Sivi is reminiscent of the story of Abraham and his son Isaac. Sivi is asked by a brāhmin for some food, and having nothing on him he offers his son as sacrifice. The brāhmin agrees, so Sivi cooks his son and prepares a meal for the brāhmin. He is then asked to consume the meal himself, but is stopped by the brāhmin who reveals it was all only a test. The son is returned to Sivi and his credibility as a virtuous man reinforced. This archetype is very similar to what God does with Abraham in Judeo-Christian mythology. The latter tale is placed by historians some time in the 2nd millennium BC, so we can posit that the archetype travelled from greater Punjab to the middle-east, possibly carried by Ānava and Druhyu migrations west. Then again the archetype could be older, the remnant of a far more ancient period. Sivi is also tested by Agni and Indra in a different tale, where Agni appears as a pigeon and pleads for Sivi to save him from Indra the falcon. Sivi offers his own flesh as food for the falcon, and the Devas are pleased with his sacrifice. Such beatitude is repeatedly showered on Sivi through his life, either by Devas or by brāhmin, and always as reward for his piety and virtue. It confirms that the early Ānavas were, in culture and in *traditio*, not too different to Pūrus.

Archaeologically, the period 3500-1900 BC is given as the urban phase of the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), also called the Oxus civilisation. Located just north of the Hindu-Kush, covering an area through modern Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the BMAC is often associated both with Aryans and the SSC. That there was trade and cultural exchange between BMAC and SSC is not in doubt, but controversy surrounds the speculated Aryan presence and its implications for the PIE-homeland theory. Viktor Sarianidi, the archaeologist who originally excavated BMAC, distinctly identified the complex as Indo-Iranian and posited a migration from Iran in the south. Depending on what prior narrative a scholar comes with, the BMAC has been taken as evidence of 1) Aryan migration into India, 2) Aryan migration out of India, 3) Linguistic substratums that support the PIE theory, and more. An honest reading shows that there is little consensus, but all scholars agree that BMAC is an important artefact in piecing together ancient history- especially a story of the Aryans. When we look at the Indian tradition and stories around Sivi and his descendants, a picture emerges that better fits the linguistic and archeological data available.

Ranging from Punjab in the south to Tajikistan in the north, the Ānavas and Druhyus have been expanding through these lands for at least seven centuries by Sivi’s time. All this while they’ve maintained cultural links with Āryavarta proper, and trade has been accompanied by war on occasion. Within Āryavarta, the spread of the SSC and the ambition of cakravartins such as Māndhātṛ continues to put an outward pressure on the peripheral tribes, leading to waves of migration out that would carry traditions, beliefs and language with them. In a sense, the geographical cluster of BMAC provides a second center of linguistic dispersal, the first being closer to northern India. From here, the people of the BMAC interact not just with the south but with all of Central Asia to their north, east and west. Archaeology also tells us that BMAC shows indications of a prior ancient population eventually merging with new arrivals to coincide with its urban phase. These new arrivals, given our chronology, are migrating Druhyus and expanding Ānavas. The prior population are the Daityas, Ādityas, Gandharvas and Yakṣas of myth.

Culturally, we know that the Ānavas in later times are at religious odds with the Vedic Bhāratas. Vedic Devas are demonic Daivas to them and Vedic Asura Varuṇa is the god of light Ahura Mazda. But in Sivi we see that this disconnect has not yet started. In his repeated feting by the Paurāṇika composers, and his own associations to Agni and Indra, we can surmise that the ideological rift later seen between proto-Iranians and Indians is yet to find seed. In fact, in the generations after Sivi and the rise of the next cakravartin we could find the antecedents of this clash and see the birth of the historical path that eventually moves Ānavas away from the Indian horizon altogether. Verse 1 of RV 10-179 is attributed to Sivi himself, and it’s a crisp and direct exhortation to submit oneself to Indra- a deity not present in later Iranian religion.

Geographically, we can show Sivi’s empire to contain all of modern Punjab and parts of north Pakistan/Afghanistan- with further expansion implied in that direction by his descendants. Within India proper, though his presence is attested even in Kāśī and Ayodhyā, we cannot speculate on any imperial conquests. And expanding from the south, the ambitious Yādavas have their sights set on the broken Pūru kingdoms- the rise of SSC proper. We will see that story next. Sivi’s reign marks the commencement of the Ravi Phase, a period during which pre-Harappan sites of the greater Punjab area are consolidated culturally and politically. This is also the period when Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Kot Diji are established- all of them falling in the kingdoms associated with Sivi and his descendants. The Ravi and Kot Diji phases of SSC are thus to be associated with this early Ānava dynasty, Sivi’s status as cakravartin owed to his leadership of the greater Punjab area. His empire could also have included Rakhigarhi and Bhirrana, though there is no support for this. There existed a power vacuum among the Pūrus at this time, the Yādavas were colonising the lower Sarasvatī and Yamunā, and other tribes such as Haihayas were busy attacking kingdoms on the Gangetic Plains.

The next ruler in the cakravartin list is Arjuna Kārtavīrya of the Haihaya dynasty. Paurāṇika synchronisms line up well by his time between a number of different dynasties and ṛṣi families. But Ṛgvedic evidence instead confuses these synchronisms. This revolves around the identification of Viśvāmitra, a popular figure to both, Purāṇas and the Ṛgveda. A complete exploration of the Ṛgvedic Viśvāmitra is conducted in Chapter 6, so for now we can follow Paurāṇika tradition and catch up on a few dynasties, including Kārtavīrya’s.
