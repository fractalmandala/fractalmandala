title: a note on transliteration

For transliteration of Saṃskṛtam words, this book uses the International Alphabhet of Saṃskṛtam Transliteration (IAST). The symbols used and their pronunciation guide are given here. Letters in bold signify the pronunciation. An error common to modern pronunciation comes from a misunderstanding of ā vs. a. Consider the words Rama, Yoga and Krishna. In common speech they’re pronounced as Rāmā, Yogā and Krishnā whereas the correct pronunciation is Rāma, Yoga and Kṛṣṇa respectively. There’s no long ā at the end of these words. The difference can be subtle but changes meaning in some cases. For example, two primary ancient Indian dynasties were the Bhāratas and Sāgaras. Notice the positioning of ā in these names. They are patronymics, or names derived from a paternal founder. The founders themselves were named Bharata and Sagara- neither has an ā. The point on patronymics bears reiteration. Vasiṣṭha is the first name of a ṛṣi, but Vāsiṣṭha refers to any ṛṣi descended from Vasiṣṭha- biological or otherwise. Thus we have Viśvāmitra and Vaiśvāmitras, Aṅgira and Āṅgirasas, Bhṛgu and Bhārgavas, and Agastya and Āgastyas to give a few examples.

As a language focused on speech and pronunciation, Saṃskṛtam need not be tied to a particular script. Apart from a few exceptions, any script will do as long as it captures pronunciation accurately. In this regard, IAST is well up to the task, and this book uses the system for Saṃskṛtam words. Anglicised words are not rendered into IAST. So while ‘Ārya’ appears with diacritics, ‘Aryan’ won’t. Similarly, names of ancient cities like Prayāga will appear with diacritics but modern ones like Prayagraj won’t. In the case of names with continuity, such as Ayodhya, where ‘Ayodhyā’ appears we talk of the historic city and where ‘Ayodhya’ appears we refer to the modern one.

One linguistic bias must be apologised for. Tamil is equally a heritage language of India, its texts no less important to our history and culture. But this book does not render Tamil with diacritics, and references to Tamil literature are all anglicised. This should not give the impression that Saṃskṛtam has primacy over Tamil. They are the two eyes of Indian civilisation and heritage. Being born to Hindi-speaking parents, understanding Saṃskṛtam pronunciation and diacritics has been easier for me, and the absence of similar regard for Tamil is only evidence of my lethargy.
