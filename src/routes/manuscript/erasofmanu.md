We’ve seen how Bali is placed in the Cākṣuṣa manvantara, the one preceding our own. It derives its name from Cakṣu, a king born in the line of Uttānapāda, Svāyambhuva’s second son. This is where we can pick our story up from. We are given a line of fifteen kings starting from Uttānapāda and ending at Pracetas, a bridge between the past eras, of Gods and Demons, and the current manvantara, the era of Man. Further, it gives us a clear picture of the emergence of leadership and civilisation in India, along with a way to link tradition with actual history as revealed by archaeology. But what of the intervening manvantaras?
