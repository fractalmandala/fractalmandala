Born 41 generations after Vaivasvat in the Aikṣvāku line, Sagara’s reign represents the closure of a long epoch. Paurāṇika tradition marks the nested Tretā Yuga to commence with Sagara’s coronation, meaning that the years between Arjuna Kārtavīrya and him form an interlude period between the nested Satya and Tretā Yugas. His is the dynasty that maps to Ochre Coloured Pottery Culture (OCP), the Gangetic civilisation of the 4th-2nd millenniums BC. OCP sites are more commonly found in the 2nd millennium BC and are associated with copper hoards, spreading across modern Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. To equate all of this with any single dynasty is gross oversimplification. But if we look to the antecedents of true civilisational organisation in the Gangetic Plains, to the early monarchs that would have ushered a transition from Neolithic to Chalcolithic and then Bronze Age, we need look no further than Sagara’s dynasty. Starting with Sagara himself, five cakravartins feature in this line of kings, making it the single largest contributor to the list.
