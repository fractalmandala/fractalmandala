The previous sections have established a historical framework for consequent stories. Now we must establish an absolute chronology. We know, broadly, when the Ṛgveda was composed (3rd millennium BC, with some hymns much older) and when the SSC matured (3rd millennium BC again). But when did Yayāti live? Or Māndhātṛ? Or Bharata and Rāma? These are important questions, for their stories intertwine with the archaeology and history available. In this reconciliation we only have textual and astronomical data at hand, for these were times before writing, and long before kings attested their names on coins or in inscriptions. But let’s first recall the chronological paradigm of our time, the Common Era vs. the Before Common Era. We know that this was not the calendar of all people in history, especially of the ancient Indians. How then does an Indian calendar map to the modern one? How do we know what year of Indian reckoning corresponds to year 1 AD of the modern era? Every civilisation uses a different calendar, and what is Year 1 for one culture is but Year 6,000 for another. This problem was faced by historians many times over when the histories of China, India, Egypt, Africa, Greece, Judaism, Mesopotamia and South America had to be mapped consistently along a BC-AD graph. In the Indian context the first key was provided by a curious name among Greek records- Sandrocottus.
