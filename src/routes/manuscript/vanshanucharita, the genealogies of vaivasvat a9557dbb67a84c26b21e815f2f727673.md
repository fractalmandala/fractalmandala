By the 5th millennium BC we’ve arrived at the era of Vaivasvat Manu, seventh of his title. We’ve started in the Mesolithic and chronicled the Neolithic. Witnessed the rise of early tribes already mythological, then of dynasties with remote historicity, and finally of the first plausible monarch. And yet all of this was deep history even to ancient Indians, who began their own reckoning with Vaivasvat Manu. In 4302 BC onsets the major Dvāpara Yuga and a nested minor cycle, the cycle that was current to the people we’ll now discuss. The early version of PIE is now prevalent across northern India, and civilisational roots such as agriculture, pottery and town planning have indigenous antecedents. The transition period between the 6th and 7th manvantaras began with the departure of the Pracetas and ends with yet another flood myth.

Empowered with the magic-shamanism of early ṛṣis and the cultural wisdom of Daitya/Āditya tribes (who will soon be married into), the Mānava tribes now appear ready for true civilisation. Farming and animal husbandry are well established, experiments with copper have commenced, deep-rooted myths have travelled across the land, astronomical expertise exists in all aspects of life, and vocational specialisation is the nature of tribal existence. Not all tribes are engaged in all activities. Some till the land and celebrate the change of seasons, marking their myths with the knowledge of when rains will come and when the soil is ready for sowing. Some play with metal and ore, their songs wondering to the magic of fire and what it can produce when shiny things are thrown into it. Others breed cattle and worship the goddesses of fertility, their myths making sacred the cycle of birth and reproduction. Still more defy the emergent social order, distancing themselves with esoteric lifestyles that proto-urban folk find distasteful. But the early chroniclers of this era will document all these people as descendants of Vaivasvat Manu.
