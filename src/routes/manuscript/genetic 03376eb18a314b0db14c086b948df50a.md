As a field of hard, scientific data, genetics stands alone. To project it on history we need to provide a robust base built on textual, archaeological and linguistic evidence. The AIT in its current form is the Indian implication of a linguistically accepted theory on the PIE homeland. But AIT has no textual or archaeological evidence, and linguistic analysis along a Preservation Principle can argue for an Indian origin of PIE. There are and can be many arguments in this field, but between genetics and the AIT there is strictly no connection. Language and genes may originate the same way- through fact of who we are born to- but they evolve and disperse very differently. Genetic analysis of a thousand years from now cannot reveal what language you spoke at your deathbed. It can only supplement a contextual base of your life- where you lived, when, who your parents were, whether you left any writings behind, etc. These facts understood, in a paper titled The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central Asia, the genetic diversity of India has been shown to be composed of three genetic groups:

- First Indians- A band of humans that arrived from Africa 65,000 years ago.
- Second Indians- A second band that arrived somewhere around 7000 BC.
- Third Indians- A primarily male population that arrived in the 2nd millennium BC.

There are conceptual problems in the paper’s terminology, which equates genetics with cultural lifestyles to an unsubstantiated degree. For example, the third Indians are named “Steppe Pastoralists” on the common assumption of the Yamnaya Culture as the PIE homeland. But the researchers concede that the path by which this ancestry arrived in India is uncertain. Further, the researchers admit that the location of the initial formation of Yamnaya ancestry is uncertain. In other words, all we know is that some people arrived in India in the 2nd millennium BC, we know neither that they were pastoralists nor that they truly came from the Steppe! Genetic data here has clearly been fit to an existing paradigm on PIE origins and AIT.

We’re fortunate that the researchers found no evidence of a BMAC ancestry in Indian genetics, for such an occurrence would surely have been taken as confirmation of the theory that Indo-Iranians stopped at BMAC for a few generations before splitting up and proceeding to India and Iran. When we understand the terminology this way we can see why it’s better to talk of genetics as genetics alone, unless it has true supplements in fundamental fields. For example, Indian literature will readily attest to an influx of primarily male populations from central Asia in the 2nd and 1st millennia BC. It will relate how these populations merged with local culture and language and were completely Indianised, explaining the lack of archaeological evidence. It also makes obvious that this influx was directed towards India and not Iran, which explains why this “Yamnaya ancestry” is not found in Iranian populations (which it should be if it were truly migrating Aryans).

In the context of AIT this third band of Indians is the problematic point, for it’s equated with the arrival of Aryans into India. But we understand by now that any attempt to equate genetics with language is fraught with issues. Under extreme critique it harks to race science, now discarded as a legitimate field. But genes are real while races were not, so this does give genetics greater weight. Yet when genetics is mapped to language and culture it does essentially the same thing that racism does, especially because it does so under a priori narratives. Only when equipped with a prior narrative for the arrival of Central Asians in India in the 2nd millennium (bringing Saṃskṛtam and the Vedas) would one equate a genetic influx with it. A true examination reveals Saṃskṛtam and the Ṛgveda to be indigenous to India in 2500 BC, and make such equations immediately untenable. Only a prejudice to find Dravidians in Dāsas and invaders in Āryas equates the Second Indians with Harappans and Third Indians with Aryans. Honest research shows the utter vacuity of an Aryan vs. Dravidian clash on all counts- textual, linguistic, and archaeological. Similar reasons make other terminology like Ancestral North Indians and Ancestral South Indians distasteful, giving unnecessary colour to the genetic truths that do exist.

Notice also the other inconsistencies in such a conclusion. The Steppe Pastoralists went to Europe first, in 3000 BC, where their ancestry can be found today to be >50%. The people then came to India after 2000 BC and the ancestry here is <25%. Where the genes went the most, language is attested later and culture is non-existent. Where the genes went the least, language is attested earlier and the culture appears in full bloom. Do we need any other evidence to delink genetics, language and culture?

These points alone should preclude further discussion into yDNA, mtDNA or haplo-groups. Not because this isn’t science, or because it tells us nothing about the story of humanity. But because when discussing a purely linguistic theory and its application to India in the absence of any textual or archaeological evidence, whatever we search for will not be found in genetics. We started this chapter by explaining that AIT is the Indian implication of a larger linguistic theory on the PIE homeland. The OIT case as outlined by Talageri, Tonoyan-Belyayev, Kazanas, Elst and others is used as a framework for the rest of this book. For readers interested to know more about existing PIE homeland theories, Maria Gimbutas’s Kurgan hypothesis and Colin Renfrew’s Anatolian agriculture hypothesis are narratives to look at. The first has the Pontic Steppe as the PIE homeland, while the latter places it in Anatolia and links language dispersal with the spread of agriculture. The Pontic Steppe is an untenable homeland for a variety of reasons discussed above. With the discovery of indigenously developed agriculture in the Indian subcontinent, the transmission of agriculture from Anatolia/Iran also has no archaeological support. These are simple reductions of important theories, but they articulate primary reasons why they’re incompatible with Indian history. Colin Renfrew has indeed agreed that there seems to be no reason to consider the Harappan and the Vedic as mutually exclusive cultures. We thus conclude with a quote from him which summarises what this chapter seeks to establish:

“*When Wheeler speaks of the Aryan invasion of the Land of Seven Rivers, he has no warranty at all, so far as I can see. If one checks the dozen references in the Ṛgveda to the seven rivers, there is nothing in any of them that to me implies an invasion. Despite Wheeler’s comments, it is difficult to see what is particularly non-Aryan about the Indus Valley*.”
