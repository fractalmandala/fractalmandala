Svāyambhuva Manu had three daughters, whose stories we have covered, and two sons- who we are yet to visit. These sons were named Priyavrata and Uttānapāda, and the Purāṇas are fairly generous on accounts of their early generations. For example, six generations after Manu in the line of Priyavrata is born Bharata, son of Rṣabhdeva. This Rṣabhdeva is considered by Jain traditions their first tīrthaṅkara, and Paurāṇika accounts often say that the name Bhāratavarṣa derives from this Bharata. But also six generations from Svāyambhuva, in the line of Diti, is Virocana the son of Prahlāda. Yet none of Manu’s patrilineal descendants feature in all the Daitya stories we’ve visited (with one exception, noted in the next chapter). The lines descending from Manu’s daughters on one hand and his sons on the other never meet each other in time and history, though they should be contemporaneous if their descent is to be taken literally.

The simple way to resolve this is to take Priyavrata’s line as ahistorical, or at least predating Svāyambhuva’s time. Evidence from this comes from literature itself. Priyavrata is said to have inherited the entire world from his father, and he divides it among his seven sons. These become the seven continents of the world as it was known to ancient Indians. A literal interpretation is that Priyavrata did indeed conquer a vast land covering Eurasia and parts of Africa, which he then divided among his sons. A different interpretation is that the world, as divided among seven broad continents, was how it existed when Svāyambhuva Manu and his descendants arrived on the scene. Given their proclivity to assign common ancestry to all people and even to all living beings, they did something similar with the ancient world as they came to discover it.

It’s helpful to remember that even in 8000 BC ancient Indians did not exist in isolation. Already by 9130 BC people had built the megalithic structure of Gobekli Tepe in modern Turkey, and there is evidence to assert that the Great Sphinx of Giza dates to a similar period. Whatever the nature of Svāyambhuva’s origin, his descendants did not uncover an uninhabited or uncivilised world. One contribution of Priyavrata’s line then is to have established a geography of the ancient world, whether it pre-existed or post-dates Manu’s era. The second contribution is equally significant. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Manus following Svāyambhuva are all Priyavrata’s sons by some accounts- Svārociṣa, Uttama, Tāmasa and Raivata. While the Purāṇas give us great details of the 1st, 6th and 7th manvantaras they are deliberately meagre with the others, explaining it by claiming that similar events happen in each manvantara. This suggests to us that both ancient geography and the concept of manvantaras pre-existed whatever history began with Svāyambhuva. The line of Uttānapāda, Manu’s younger son, is far more historical and has significant implications for how we understand ancient Indian history. The line of Priyavrata, in nearly every major Purāṇa, is a means to an account of ancient geography.
