Our planet has undergone several climatic and geological changes, many ongoing even now. Like yugas and manvantaras, geology thinks of time in terms of epochs. Of these the current epoch is called the Holocene, which began 11,500 years before present (BP) with the end of the last glacial period. Glacial periods are another geological time-keeping scale, marking the advance and retreat of world glaciers. A critical period during this is known as the Glacial Maximum- the time within a glacial period when the ice sheets are at their maximum extent. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), or most recent period when ice sheets were at their maximum extent, was 26,000-19,000 years ago, with a final retreat 15,000 years ago. The retreat of such glacial maximums is accompanied by a rapid rise in sea levels as glaciers and ice melt across the planet.

With the end of the last glacial period the planet entered a transitional phase, which meant the rising of global temperatures and the opening up of inhabitable land. But some 12,000 years ago we were pushed into another temporary glacial period known as the Younger Dryas. Lasting for around a thousand years, the Younger Dryas again reduced global temperatures and caused sea levels to drop, as the planet’s water was pulled back into ice-sheets and glaciers. While there are a number of competing theories for what pushed us into the Younger Dryas, what’s agreed is that its receding was similar to the receding of a glacial period- rise in global temperatures and sea levels, opening up of land for habitation again. In other words the conditions of the LGM recurred at a smaller scale during the Younger Dryas, having similar implications for human habitation and populations.

Periods such as the above force humans into isolated pockets of the planet. During the LGM most of Tibet, Ladakh and Baltistan were covered in ice sheets, the mountains rampant with glaciers. A permafrost covered Asia as far as Beijing, and the lowered sea levels meant that many islands were joined to continental mainlands. Geologists are not in agreement on the conditions of southern Tibet and southeastern Himālaya during the LGM. Some claim that this was a critical refuge area for humans, and many modern source ancestries could be traced back to lineages that survived through this bottleneck. The Tibetan Plateau was in prehistoric times a site of independent domestication of barley, selectively bred for cold and dry conditions.

The Holocene epoch commences with the end of the Younger Dryas. Thus the initial conditions at Holocene onset are of planetary warming, rising sea levels and massive deglaciation. This in turn opens up various river channels, and in the Indian context it meant the flowering of grand Sindhu, Sarasvatī, Yamunā, Gaṅgā and Brahmaputra rivers. This was the opening up of the planet for Mesolithic humanity, the primordial creation event of Brahmā. The entire Kathmandu valley was a large palaeo-lake prior to the Holocene, but after the Younger Dryas this too opens up and the waters are released to the lands lower south, washing them with fertility and carving deep channels for Gangetic tributaries to occupy.

Tamil tradition remembers three ancient Sangams, or conferences of Tamil culture, literature and knowledge. The first Sangam lasted 4,440 years and was presided over by 89 kings, the second lasted 3,700 years and was ruled by 59 kings, the third Sangam lasted 1,800 years and saw 49 kings. This yields a combined period of nearly 10,000 years and 197 kings. The earliest historical works of Tamil literature appear to us in the 1st millennium BC, but like Vedic and Paurāṇika literature they carry knowledge from past eras. We should remember that unlike northern India, culture in the south was concentrated near the coasts and the plains that emerge at the absolute tip. Dravidian is in fact considered a coastally dispersed language, which explains its connection to languages near both Balochistan and Bengal. Most of the coastline of ten thousand years ago now lies submerged under the ocean, and even a better land-bridge to Sri Lanka would have once been available. Sangam literature tells us that the first two Sangams happened at ‘Madurais that are lost to the sea,’ a curious parallel with what geography tells us. Ancient southern Indian settlements would have been near the coast and tip, areas that are vulnerable to oceanic tsunamis even today. Archaeology and tradition both affirm that southern India’s history lies submerged.

Assigning historical dates to these Sangams is difficult, but if we simplistically date back from when Sangam literature first appears to us we get these broad dates for the three Sangams: First Sangam ~9940 BC, Second Sangam ~5500 BC and Third Sangam ~1800 BC. The First Sangam then happened somewhere around the onset of the Holocene, and in the consequent rising of sea levels the city where it was held was submerged in the Indian Ocean. Perhaps this sparked a wave of migration inland, towards northern India. Perhaps the glacial period refugees stuck in Tibetan valleys finally emerged to uninhabited plains- ready for civilisation. For language Indian language groups- Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Tibet-Burman and Austroasiatic- this was the primeval proto-period. Beginning with the 11th-10th millennia BC the children of Brahmā are ready to populate the subcontinent, and prototypical Adam-Eve, Svāyambhuva-Śatarūpā, are up to the task.
