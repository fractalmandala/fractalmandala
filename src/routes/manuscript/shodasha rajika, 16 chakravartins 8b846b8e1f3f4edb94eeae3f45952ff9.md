# shodasha rajika, 16 chakravartins

Index: 7.2
S. No: 44
Type: 📑 manuscript

The Mahābhārata twice gives to us a list of the ṣodaśa rājika, or sixteen monarchs. Elsewhere in Paurāṇika literature, men from this list are called samrāja or cakravartin. Cakravartin is most literally translated as a universal monarch, one whose wheel moves in all directions. The first references to cakravartin appear in the monuments of Candragupta Maurya and Aśoka in the 3rd century BC, and Aśoka’s empire encompassed all of the Indian subcontinent sans the southern tip (wherever relevant, it’s difficult not to point to the absurdity of the idea that the British created India). The critical path of history, from agriculture and the wheel leading up to Iron Age weapons and vehicles, enabled a dynasty like the Mauryan to rise. But when we break cakravartin down to its constituents, cakra and vartin, we find that the title could apply to many before Candragupta.

It’s commonly assumed that cakra means only the literal wheel of a chariot, as is implied in the definition of cakravartin. But in the Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, cakra is variously defined as the wheel of a carriage, the wheel of time, a potter’s wheel, the wheel used to draw water from a well, a discus or a sharp circular weapon, the circle of a peacock’s tale, an astronomical circle, a seasonal cycle, a troop of soldiers, a number of villages, the wheel of a monarch’s chariot, the whirlpools of a river, a kind of plant and more. We should thus understand cakra to be anything circular, and often with a forward or time-bound motion. Similarly, vartin means abiding, staying, resting, being in a particular position, engaged in (something), performing something, turning, moving, going and more. Cakravartin thus refers to one who either moves the wheel or brings it to a point of rest- both an opposite force to incumbent inertia. And the wheel could be metaphorical- a wheel of time, of history, or of culture. In other words, within a philosophical framework a cakra can be likened to a maṇḍala, thus making cakravartins critical to our fractal maṇḍala.

Given that ancient Indian cakravartins are elsewhere called samrāja or rājaka, we should infer that these figures were movers of political civilisation, of the wheel of time and culture both. They may not necessarily have done so through chariots, and many in fact preceded the age of chariots. But when we find their names remembered in cakravartin lists, we should understand that even in a Chalcolithic or Neolithic age there was expansion and conquest. There was consolidation and cultural standardisation. And this was led by names later traditions remember as ancient monarchs. Our definition of monarch will obviously vary by age, for the monarch of a Neolithic tribe was very different to that of Iron Age fortified cities. But whatever the cultural and material conditions, we can be reasonably certain that there existed at the least leaders among equals. These are who we talk about, even when we project the terminology of a later age onto them. The list of sixteen cakravartins as it’s given to us is:

- Marutta Āvikṣita
- Suhotra Ātithina
- Bṛhadratha Vīra
- Sivi Auśinara
- Bharata Dauṣyanti
- Rāma Dāśarathi
- Bhagīratha Aikṣvāku
- Dilīpa Khaṭvāṅga
- Māndhātṛ Yauvanāśva
- Yayāti Nāhuṣya
- Ambarīṣa Nābhāgi
- Śaśabindu Caitraratha
- Gaya Āmūrtarayasa
- Rantideva Sāṅkṛti
- Sagara Aikṣvāku
- Pṛthu Vainya

Elsewhere we find other names such as Arjuna Kārtavīrya referred to as mahāsamrājas, or great monarchs. For two of the cakravartins listed above, Rantideva and Gaya, the only stories we really have are of their donation to brāhmins or their piety to Viṣṇu. These two also do not figure in any major genealogies, although some lineage is suggested. For example, Rantideva is said to be the son of Saṅkṛti, son of Nara, son of Bhuvamanyu in the line of Suhotra- descendant of Bharata. Yet this is not found in Bhārata family trees in any major Purāṇa. In the reconciled list this book uses, we replace Gaya with Arjuna Kārtavīrya.

That the list of sixteen rājikas is found in the Mahābhārata, and that the first true attestation of cakravartin is found in Mauryan times, are evidence that listing the sixteen monarchs involved hindsight and editorial decisions. The first cakravartin may well have been a simple head of villages, his leadership bringing nothing more than the standardisation of farming practices. But as civilisation advanced it came with the ability for greater cooperation and to wield larger, better equipped armies. We also need not take each monarch as a real historical figure per se. The point of extracting history from literature is not to find stories of individuals, but to reveal the broad strokes of ancient Indian history. How did the early tribes and dynasties arise? Was early civilisation self-emergent, or led by the actions of a few leaders? In what ways did technological advancement in trade, transport and metallurgy change society? What was the involvement of dharma in all of this, and where do the Vedas figure in the chronology? Who composed them, who compiled them, and under what conditions? These are the kinds of questions we want answers to, and we use the cakravartins as milestones in our narrative. When we relist the cakravartins according to their place in chronology, starting with Yayāti we get the following fifteen cakravartins (Pṛthu Vainya precedes this list):

1. Yayāti Nāhuṣya
2. Śaśabindu Caitraratha
3. Māndhātṛ Yauvanāśva
4. Sivi Auśinara
5. Arjuna Kārtavīrya
6. Marutta Āvikṣita
7. Sagara Aikṣvāku
8. Bharata Dauṣyanti
9. Bhagīratha Aikṣvāku
10. Ambarīṣa Nābhāgi
11. Suhotra Ātithina
12. Rantideva Sāṅkṛti
13. Dilīpa Khaṭvāṅga
14. Rāma Dāśarathi
15. Bṛhadratha Vīrya

This is the order we’ll visit the 7th manvantara in, and names from position 7 to 14 will be clubbed under the Sāgara and Bhārata dynasties. In the previous section we covered the genealogy from Vaivasvat Manu to his early progeny. In the line of his daughter, Ilā, appears the first recorded cakravartin of the 7th manvantara.
