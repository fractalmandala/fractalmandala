1. The destruction of a mosque by a mob in 1992, in a constitutional democracy, was regrettable and should have happened differently. The democracy is held to a much higher standard than is the bigoted conqueror, and rightly so.

2. There was a Ram Mandir at the site, destroyed by Babur.

3. Ram is a national figure of pan-national relevance.

4. There is nothing wrong in the Supreme Court making a legal ruling on the property dispute, even if it is in favour of the “Ram-side.”

5. Aphorism 1 held true, India is still secular even if it does allot the site to Hindus.

6. The actions of aphorism 1 should never be repeated.

Additional aphorisms:

7. Ram Mandir today is a politically charged issue with multiple sides trying to rake political points, and in some cases successfully so.

8. Mandir destroyed-so mosque destroyed-so never forget: this kind of cycle can, in theory, repeat endlessly. We must be careful where to go from here.

9. Kashi and Mathura will also be reclaimed, even if that violatest point 1 all over again. Deal with it.
