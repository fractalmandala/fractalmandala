Simply put, what the Aryan Invasion/Migration/Trickling-in Theory (AIT) claims is this: After 2000 BC, a tribe or tribes of Indo-European language speakers invaded/migrated into India, bringing with them Saṃskṛta and the Vedic culture. This claim has a number of implications attached to it. One, it implies that there exists an indigenous vs. invader divide in India, such that some of us are ādivāsi (original inhabitant) while others are not. Two, it implies that there exists a Dravidian vs. Aryan divide, roughly dividing India into a north and a south. Three, it implies that Vedic culture and religion are foreign imports, meaning we should not begrudge overmuch the ravages of later foreign cultures, nor claim nativity to our own traditions. 

Refuting such a theory and its claims is not an act of nationalistic chauvinism. One should have no aversion to accepting this theory and necessary implications, if but they were true. Any attempts to refute the theory are labelled ‘indigenist’ or ‘revisionist,’ implying that such attempts are agenda-driven from the outset and further- that the existing paradigm is the result of objective, non-dogmatic methodology. In fact, if attempts to refute AIT are revisionist, we must remember that any dogmatic dismissal of this is ‘reputationist.’ Decades of careers, university positions, book deals and reputations have been built on the AIT (and its receding successors). If refuting it is a revisionist act, surely dismissing revisions is a reputationist act. In a world where students can access any information on the internet instantly, a reputationist must work doubly hard to keep his position secure. Another ruling paradigm is the invasionist/migrationist one, which sees all cultural changes as the result of intrusions or influx from outside. This is a necessary paradigm for a culture that’s own expanse has been based on it, for it not to have cognitive dissonance. 

##### In reality only the truth matters. It’s of no consequence what one’s agenda is, if the truth can stand on its own. This is why when even non-Indians have approached the problem without reputationist concerns, they’ve found compelling reasons to either refute AIT or to argue for variations of an out-of-India model (Colin Renfrew, Michel Danino, Alexander Semenenov, Igor Tonoyan-Belyayev, Nicholas Kazanas, Koenraad Elst to name a few).

There is a partly jocular rule when it comes to the AIT. The rule is that the original Indo-European homeland tends to be close to the author’s native land. On this count I must disclaim- I was born in Benaras, and for millennia my ancestors have dwelt on the Gaṅgā’s banks, though I personally haven’t. Clearly I am motivated and could be possessed of a chauvinistic agenda. But let’s see what the truth says about itself. 

Of the many mysteries to human origins, perhaps the most baffling is language. Unlike the wheel or agriculture, we cannot find archaeological ‘evidence’ for language origin, and till the advent of writing we have little to go on in visualising human speech and communication. Some like Noam Chomsky attribute language to a chance mutation that occurred in our ancestors at a single point in time. Others like Steven Pinker are inclined towards a continuum, where language emerged from precursors among our primate ancestors. Also unlike the wheel or agriculture, which are known to have emerged multiple times across different populations, linguists favour a single-origin model of language. This makes sense given that we link language to genetics, and the work of Luigi Luca Cavalli- Sforza<sup>1</sup> does show that “the family tree relating human populations corresponds to another relating the languages of the world.” The correlation is not a congruence however, and linguist George Driem<sup>2</sup> cautions that “linguistic ancestors are not the same set of people as genetic ancestors.” 

A specific protein called FOXP2 is commonly called the language gene, because of its association with the development of speech and language in humans. The gene appears in many vertebrates, and in birds it drives birdsong while in bats it’s behind echolocation. We know that Neanderthals too possessed this gene, but that other genes are also necessary for human language development. Yet the association of FOXP2 with language reflects the intuition of a single origin of language. This intuition is reflected in the Judeo-Christian myth of the Tower of Babel, where the human survivors of a great flood originally speak the same language, but are then scattered around the world by God, their speech confounded such that they no longer understand each other. We now know that such myths are grounded in reality, and by the 18th century AD European linguists had conceptualised an Uralic language family which linked Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian and other languages together. Thus both mythical paradigm and scientific precedence were well established when Europeans first discovered Saṃskṛta. 

##### Yet Saṃskṛta opened the doors like they’d never been before. In its archaic preservation, in its immaculate structure as presented by Pāṇini, its deep study of grammar, syntax and pronunciation- Saṃskṛta was a key that unlocked the whole field of linguistics. 

Linguistic terms that put off the lay reader- gutturals, retroflexes, labio-velars and others- are but how Saṃskṛta and other Indian languages have always presented and organised their alphabet. The study of Saṃskṛta helped early linguists map language inter- relationships to a hitherto unprecedented degree, birthing an entire field called Comparative Linguistics (CL). Prior to this there was no systematic grammar, no formal understanding of language. But after CL emerged filial relationships between language groups- Celtic, Italic, Germanic, Baltic, Slavonic, Albanian, Greek, Anatolian, Armenian, Tocharian, Iranian and Indo-Aryan. Of these, the last two are groups where the term Aryan is attested. It’s contained in the very name of Iran, and in India it first appeared in the Ṛgveda as ārya. Indo-Aryan is not called Indian to avoid confusion with other Indian language families such as Dravidian. 

It was established through the work of successive linguists that these language groups descended from a common mother language, called proto-Indo-European (PIE). And the groups themselves are now referred to as the Indo-European (IE) language family. More than 40% of modern humans speak a language from this family, making it the single largest language group by far. This makes consequent questions all the more important, for they have deep implications in the history of humanity. If a language such as PIE existed, where did it exist? Who spoke it? When was it spoken? And in what way did it disperse from this original homeland to all the regions where its descendants are now extant? 

Notice the assumptions built into such questions. We assume that the moment in time represented by PIE also represents origins for all the culture, religion and lifestyle possessed by PIE-speaking people. In other words, PIE is implicitly taken not just as a mother-language but a mother-culture. But if Vedic culture- described by Saṃskṛta- is inherited from PIE, what proves that PIE culture wasn’t inherited from its own mother language? The search for a PIE homeland is in fact Western civilisation’s search for its ultimate roots. 

If we place the PIE homeland within India, our speculations can be clubbed as the out-of-India theory (OIT). If we place the homeland, as is usually done, anywhere outside India, the theory for India is by definition that of Aryan Invasion (AIT). We won’t involve ourselves with academic sophistry that modifies AIT as a model of Aryan migration instead. The necessary implication of AIT, that Vedic culture and Saṃskṛta were brought to India from outside and gained dominance over a demographic majority, mandates that this happened through a kind of invasion. We should keep in mind that AIT was formulated well before the discovery of Harappan civilisation, and the latter’s discovery first prompted images of chariot-riding Aryans destroying peaceful Harappan cities. 

When no evidence of this invasion was found, the Aryan arrival was dated to follow the Harappan demise such that a small, foreign population somehow managed to establish its language and culture over a demographic heavyweight shifting its base from Sindhu-Sarasvatī to Gaṅgā-Yamunā. Everything that such models imply requires a domination/invasion, and cannot be achieved by peaceful migration. Both in any case are untenable and without evidence.

##### Throughout this text, when we say AIT we refer to the gamut of invasion/migration/trickling-in/peaceful-resettlement/touring theories that all nevertheless imply the same things. 

A refutal of AIT is not predicated upon refuting PIE itself. While there are conceptual problems with CL, we accept the basic linguistic implication that Saṃskṛta is a sister language to the other IE languages- not a mother. This means that Saṃskṛta was not PIE but an equal descendant of it, even if more archaic or closer to the original. In our examination of AIT we’ll stick to the facts of the case, and it need not be important what the motivations of early Europeans were. Some like Voltaire had no problem admitting to Indian antiquity and civilisational greatness. Others like Muller viewed all things Indian through a narrow Christian lens. We will of course have to consider the motivations of modern reputationists, for they form the dam (with deepening cracks) that holds back true narratives of Indian history. The current IE situation is best expressed by Michel Danino<sup>3</sup> in his paper ‘The Indo-European Cloudland’: 

> “Although the Indo-European (IE) homeland theory has taken many forms and colours, it rests on the central assumption of an isolated, single proto-language in an isolated, single homeland, from which, at some point in time, Proto-Indo-European (PIE) people burst out in almost every direction to sow their linguistic seeds. But no one knows for sure where, when, why or how: after two centuries of intensive studies and often acrimonious debates, Indo-Europeanists cannot agree on the particular homeland or the date of the great dispersal.” 

It’s pertinent to note that the PIE and AIT theories are linguistic at heart. Indeed, linguists insist that questions on PIE and its homeland can be answered by linguistics alone. Another way to put this is that “pots don’t speak.” Which means that archaeology can tell us nothing about the languages of people, their origins or their dispersals. While AIT in India need be discussed in the contexts of textual, archaeological, genetic and astronomical evidence as well, let us consider the linguistic first. If linguists are right about the primacy of their field in settling the debate, the following section should suffice to establish OIT. 

#### Linguistic 

Here we have The Oxford Introduction to PIE and the PIE World by JP Mallory and DQ Adams<sup>4</sup> as a guiding light. In this eminently accessible text for the lay-reader, they examine the evidence of linguistics to explain how hypothetical PIE is reconstructed and what it implies about aspects of PIE people and their culture- physical landscape, flora and fauna, kinships and family structures, settlement/ dwelling patterns, material culture, diet, religion, mythology and ultimate origins. We get an insight into the ever-changing nature of CL, indeed of PIE itself, through Schleicher’s Tale. August Schleicher, a founding father of CL, attempted to write a complete story in reconstructed PIE. Reconstructed PIE is a hypothetical language that CL builds from its understanding of present or historically attested languages. The first sentence of Schleicher’s Tale was: 

*avis, jasmin varnā na ā ast, dadarka akvams.*

Which translated to- “A sheep that had no wool saw horses.” 

In 1939 Hermann Hirt provided an updated version- owis, jesmin wbl!nā ne ēst, dedork’e ek’wons. This came after Hirt removed the “clear sign of predominance of Saṃskṛta in reconstruction.” The first reconstruction predominantly uses the a vowel, but by the second reconstruction o, e and i gain primacy. This reflects the linguistic position that PIE used a number of vowels, which Saṃskṛta later reduced to a single a sound. But we have the real example of Romani, the IE language of gypsies which is known to have migrated out of India. Its predecessor possessed only the a vowel, while Romani possesses o, e and i as well. So we know that the change can happen in any direction. 

An updated reconstruction was made in 1979 by Winfred Lehmann and L. Zgusta- owis, kwesyo wȴhnā ne ēst, eǩwons espeǩet. If this doesn’t appear arcane, the current reconstruction that was provided in 1997 by Douglas Adams should interest the reader- h2ówis, kwésyo wȴh2néh4ne (h1é) est, h1éǩwons spéǩet. Needless to say, we are asked to accept every step as hard science. Granted, there is some merit to it. The predictive power of CL was tested in a reconstruction of Latin from Romance languages- to test whether the reconstruction would be similar to actual Latin, which is well attested. It was, and linguists have been emboldened ever since to lead us to the truth through their science alone. 

It’s interesting that of all the nations and civilisations in the world, India is the only country where our history is told to us by linguists, who incidentally developed their field through analysis of Saṃskṛta. IE languages dispersed across Eurasia, but this hasn’t made some Germans more indigenous than others, or some Englishmen ādivāsi over the rest. The histories and population divides of these countries are formed through a composite of several disciplines, but in India linguistic theories decide real divisions. Let’s accept for now that linguists can indeed reconstruct entirely hypothetical languages of the past. Doing so allows us to examine the conclusions made by Mallory-Adams about the original PIE homeland, its climate, flora, fauna and other conditions. 

On the physical landscape of PIE, the authors conclude that 

> “The picture provided by the reconstructed lexicon is not very informative concerning the physical environment of the speakers of the ancestral language, although there have been scholars enough who have tried to press the slender evidence into revealing the precise location (or type of location) inhabited by the Proto-Indo-Europeans.” 

AIT theories should be on shaky ground given the above conclusion alone. When a detailed, often arcane, reconstruction of PIE yields nothing conclusive about the precise location of the PIE people, how are we to already conclude the invasion/migration of an Aryan tribe in India after 2000 BC? Interestingly, a great deal of reputationist effort has gone to linguistically proving that the PIE homeland cannot have been in India. Much salience is given to the field of linguistic palaeontology, which reconstructs environment, flora and fauna to imagine the PIE world. For example, Mallory- Adams conclude that PIE did not originally have a word for sea, and that an existing word for an inland lake was instead projected to the ocean. This implies that the PIE homeland was not near the coast but in a landlocked area. Such a conclusion excludes India from consideration, for Indians based whether in the peninsula or along Sarasvatī, Sindhu and Gaṅgā knew where these rivers met the ocean. Simultaneously, it affirms any theory that places the PIE homeland around the Caspian Sea or the Pontic Steppe. 

The PIE word in question here is *mori, and the question is whether it was originally a word for an ‘inland lake’ that got transferred to the ‘sea’, or the other way around. The asterisk before a word indicates that it’s reconstructed in a hypothetical language. It’s not a real word per se, but an approximation of what the word might have been in the hypothesised language. Mallory-Adams use the example of English, which is a maritime language, where the equivalent words moor and marsh refer to an inland body of water, and not the sea. This evidences to them that *mori was originally used similarly, and that there was no PIE word equivalent for the sea. But Shrikant Talageri<sup>5</sup> points out that there is a PIE antecedent for sea in the Proto-Germanic *saiwa. Modern German uses see for lake and meer for sea, while Dutch uses meer for lake and zee for sea. Clearly, using the singular evidence of English to make a larger conclusion on PIE itself is untenable, yet Mallory-Adams do not stop there. 

They conclude that words for sea in other IE languages such as Greek or Indo-Aryan must have been borrowed from non-IE sources. This renders the word samudra, though patently Indo-Aryan, a loanword from a non-Indo-Aryan language in their reckoning. But Talageri again points to the word mīra (pronounced similar to German meer) in Pāṇini’s Uṇādi Sūtras, which Pāṇini translated as samudra. By Pāṇini’s own admission, mīra was a word his rules could not derive, implying that it was more archaic than the Saṃskṛta lexicon of his time. Since mīra here means the sea, its antiquity suggests that this was the original meaning of the PIE *mori, and invalidates Mallory-Adams’ conclusion that the PIE homeland was a landlocked region which only knew inland lakes. 

Samudra comes from sam + udram, where sam means together with or altogether and udra means water. Between an ocean and a lake, it’s the former where all the waters truly come together. The ‘sea- argument’ thus does nothing to refute an OIT model, nor does it offer anything to prove an AIT one. Geographical information from reconstructed PIE tells us nothing about the homeland, nor excludes India from consideration. 

On the PIE climate, Mallory-Adams again concede that *“(the reconstructed words) attest a basic range of atmospheric phenomena but nothing decisively as to where precisely the proto-Indo-Europeans lived.”* But they point that words such as *ćaka (thin ice), *ćäke (hard snow), *kum3 (thin snow) and *kura (fine snow) indicate a cold environment. Here again AIT is not necessarily vindicated. From the Himālaya to the Pamir Mountains and the many ranges that snake out from this roof of the world, snow in all forms was familiar to the ancient Indians. We need not posit an invasion from Pontic Steppe or Siberia to explain these reconstructed words in the PIE lexicon. The current leading AIT doyen (though he calls it not an invasion), Michael Witzel, insists that the PIE homeland was situated in a temperate climate. He uses this to dismiss any out-of-India scenario because, as we all know, India is a tropical country. 

Apart from Witzel’s reliance on a “cold” place familiar with “wolves and snow,” we do not really know what he means by a temperate climate. But here is a map of temperate locations in the world according to the Koppen climate classification, the most widely used climate classification system in the world:

<img class="centerimage" style="width: 75%" src="/images/maptemperate.jpg" alt="map"/>

The map above shows locations of the world with degrees of temperate climate. It’s only for the recent decades, and the climate situation in 2000 BC or earlier could have been very different. But this map is a helpful indicator that no classification of the PIE homeland as a temperate/cold place necessarily eliminates India from consideration. In any case, when we say ‘India’ here we mean a very large geography that includes the Tibetan Plateau as well as the Pamir Mountains. 

The eastern Himālaya are already speculated to be the homeland of two other language groups, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic (the latter is not conclusive, and its homeland could be anywhere between the eastern Himālaya and Southeast Asia). The modern Indian states of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, along with the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, have long been a global thoroughfare, with all kinds of peoples, languages and cultures both originating and travelling through here. No conclusions on the PIE climate necessarily exclude the Tibet/Terai/north Gangetic Plains from consideration. Notice also in the above map that neither the Pontic Steppe nor Anatolia proper are classified temperate. 

From the reconstructed lexicon of PIE flora and fauna, Mallory- Adams conclude that the PIE people *“possessed a Neolithic economy with extensive references to domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goat, pig; possibly horse).”* Note how different this image is to that of nomadic chariot-warriors raiding urban settlements with horse cavalries, and also that the above description might as well be talking about early Jhusi, Lahuradewa or Bhirrana-like cultures. Witzel argues that words such as wolf and snow are necessarily the linguistic memories of a colder climate and prove the AIT, though it’s left unanswered why Indians familiar to the Himalayan ranges or Greater Tibet would not have possessed these words. Talageri uses evidence of reconstructed PIE words for the tiger, lion, leopard, monkey, elephant and horse to firmly establish an OIT model as the only viable scenario. 

Mallory-Adams caution against using negative evidence, that is, the absence of evidence as the evidence of absence. But if we are to, as is done in the wolf and snow argument, then it should be noticed that you will not find elephants and monkeys in the Steppe, nor tigers and wolves in Anatolia. But you will find them all in India. Similarly, the reconstruction of a typical PIE settlement as that made of timber, wattle and daub and wholly prior to the use of bricks has been used as an argument in favour of AIT. The Indus Valley Civilisation widely used baked bricks, or iṣtakās- a word not found in the Ṛgveda. Taking this to be a confirmation of AIT is a result of confusing the chronology and timeline of the Ṛgveda. Ever since Max Muller, the Ṛgveda is dated to around 1200 BC, leading to the narrative of Aryans arriving in India by 1500 BC, bringing Saṃskṛta and Vedic culture. The lower limit here is set by iron, or its absence in the Ṛgveda, indicating it preceded the Iron Age. The upper limit comes from the lack of baked-bricks. 

Both the upper and lower limits for the date of the Ṛgveda are set by taking absence of evidence as evidence of absence. Incidentally, using this principle also indicates that the Ṛgvedic people knew ghee but not milk (since the Ṛgveda is familiar with the former but does not refer to the latter). Such is the flimsy and frankly shoddy intellectual ground that AIT theories rest on. Further, wattle-and- daub structures relying on timber were the primary settlement mode in the Gangetic Plains from at least 7000 BC. Once again- none of this necessarily excludes them from consideration as the PIE homeland (where the homeland extends north to Tibet). 

A reconstruction of PIE words for basic kinship ties deserves special attention. Not only because it shows clearly the relationship between IE family branches, but also because it demonstrates a linguistic principle that confirms the OIT model. Consider the following table (rendered without IAST): 

<img class="centerimage" style="width: 75%" src="/images/chart1.png" alt="chart"/>

The similarities between mother, father, brother and sister are clear in the above languages, even on basic sight and sound. But what of son and daughter, where for Saṃskṛta modern Indo-Aryan speakers would instead wager putra and putrī? The apparent connections between IE languages are not just phonetic or visual. They’re based on a deeper connection in shared root sounds or syllables. Since words can often be borrowed between languages, mere phonetic similarity doesn’t suffice to establish a connection. On this account, the connection between an English son and a Dutch zoon would not have been apparent without the discovery of the Saṃskṛta sūnu. 

Stemming from the root sū, which meant to birth or beget, sūnu meant one who birthed- pushed the family line forward- and also one who sowed or begat seed in the earth. Once the Saṃskṛta sūnu was discovered, a reconstructed PIE word could be established and connections mapped to other IE languages. The roots of daughter too are evident only from an investigation of Saṃskṛta, where it stems from the root duh, which meant to milk, and indicates that the daughter’s role was to milk the cow in the PIE household (incidentally, this confirms that the early PIE state was Neolithic, with animal husbandry and proto-agriculture). Alternately, duh meant to milk, in the sense of a daughter that was of child-bearing age. Both sūnu and duhitṛ are thus built atop biological and vocational roles of the PIE son and daughter. The linguistic principle at play here is what Nicholas Kazanas refers to as the Preservation Principle (PP). Before we define it, let us look at another table, this time of the comparative theonyms (names of gods) in some IE languages: 

<img class="centerimage" style="width: 75%" src="/images/chart2.png" alt="chart"/>

The above list only considers languages that have retained a considerable set of IE theonyms, but each theonym listed is certain to be IE. We know this because each theonym is present in at least three different families- a situation that could not arise if it were independently developed. In the case of Parjanya, we have the additional evidence of Perkunu from the Slavonic family. Saṃskṛta is presented in the first column to make clear its all-inclusiveness. Of all the IE language families, it has preserved the largest set of theonyms. Further, no two non-Saṃskṛta families have preserved a theonym that is not also present in Saṃskṛta. Now have a look at the earliest that the IE language families have been attested in history: 

<img class="centerimage" style="width: 75%" src="/images/chart3.png" alt="chart"/>

The current theory has the PIE people originate in the Pontic Steppe in ~3000 BC, spread to Europe over the next thousand years, and begin their journey to India in ~2000 BC- where five centuries later they compose the Ṛgveda. Is it not strange that the IE languages of the original homeland (Balto-Slavic) are attested the latest, only five hundred years ago? And if the PIE people were migrating to Europe between 3000 and 2000 BC, why is it that the first attestations there are found only after 1000 BC? The intellectual deceit here should be obvious. How is it that in the place where the PIE people went first- Europe- the languages are attested much later and only a few IE theonyms present, while in the place where the PIE people went later- India- the language is attested much earlier and that too with the full theonym set? Only in India in fact do the PIE people arrive just in time to compose the largest attested corpus in any IE language- the Vedic- whereas in mainland Europe they did no such thing! 

This is where we should bring the Preservation Principle, which Nicholas Kazanas<sup>6</sup> defines such- the people or culture that has preserved the most has moved least. In his words, 

> “It is a well known fact of history that people on the move for a long period tend to lose elements of their culture while their language suffers changes, as they meet with other cultures and/or have little leisure to pass their lore to the new generations.” 

Both in the case of sūnu/duhitṛ and of the IE theonyms, Saṃskṛta scores highest on the Preservation Principle, indicating that it has moved the least. This brings the PIE homeland to northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kazanas supplements this with observing PP even in the sphere of poetics. “There is hardly a major poetic device in the various IE branches that is not also present in the Ṛgveda.” Koenraad Elst<sup>7</sup> sees additional evidence come in this regard through Nick Allen, who showed that Indian traditions have retained both gross and subtle layers, while others only the gross. The principle extends to Saṃskṛta as a whole, and Kazanas quotes another linguist, Burrow: 

> “Vedic is a language which in most respects is more archaic and less altered from original Indo-European than any other member of the family.” 

The above comes from a linguistically rigorous analysis of roots, stems and etymologies, examples from which have been discussed above. Here too the principle is evident, and while we can never linguistically prove or disprove a specific homeland, it becomes clear that this homeland was closest to north India than it was to any other purported homeland. Linguists with different PIE homeland leanings reject this principle. To them these aspects of Saṃskṛta at best evidence its archaic nature, and not that it moved least from the homeland. Kazanas goes a step further, and argues that the archaic nature has been preserved because Saṃskṛta has moved the least from the PIE homeland. 

We can understand this better by trying to apply the principle to a different homeland, say the Pontic Steppe. The IE languages native in this geographical area are Baltic and Slavic. If we posit the Steppe as the PIE homeland, we have to explain why the Slavic languages lost Agni, Varuṇa and Yama, while the people who eventually reached north India managed to retain the full set despite their generations- long, arduous journey. This is supplemented with the evidence of Finno-Ugric, a language family containing Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian and others. Finno-Ugric has a number of loanwords from PIE, but PIE has no loanwords from Finno-Ugric. This can happen only when a section of PIE speakers live near Finno-Ugric speakers, but so far away from the original PIE homeland that no words are transmitted back. Placing PIE in the Pontic Steppe does not fulfil this condition. Placing it in India does (so does placing it in Anatolia, but Anatolia as the PIE homeland is untenable for other reasons). 

Mallory-Adams criticise the Preservation Principle on grounds that Slavic has suffered many ravages over the years, including the ravage of Christianity. It’s unfair to compare a language as preserved as Saṃskṛta to Slavic in this view. Some might argue that languages could have existed before their first appearance in attested history- an argument that actually makes the case to antiquate Saṃskṛta more than we do! Though Saṃskṛta underwent ravages for a much longer period, and though later words such as samudra or putra came into vogue, the memory of mīra and sūnu wasn’t lost. Such a memory, Kazanas reminds us, is lost only when a people are on the move for a long period. This implies that Saṃskṛta was able to retain a link to archaic PIE roots that other languages lost. Linguists insist that the answers to PIE-questions will come from linguistics alone, yet Mallory-Adams’ tome is unable to posit either a concrete PIE homeland nor establish any AIT scenario. Using the same conclusions as them however, and supplemented with a rigorous analysis of the Ṛgveda a la Talageri or the Preservation Principle a la Kazanas, we’re able to articulate a linguistically valid OIT model. 

A linguistic argument used against OIT is the presence of Dravidian language loanwords in Saṃskṛta, which are not present in IE languages outside India. This is used to posit that PIE originated elsewhere, and only Saṃskṛta came into contact with Dravidian. But Talageri<sup>8</sup> has shown that Dravidian influences into Saṃskṛta are evident only in the later layers of the Ṛgveda, and are absent at early layers. The PIE split, though not a single event in history, occurred prior to the emergence of Dravidian influences. This means that other IE languages had already dispersed out of India by the time Saṃskṛta and Dravidian came into cultural contact. Add to this recent work by Tonoyan-Belyayev<sup>9</sup>, which not only asserts that Dravidian influences in Indo-Aryan are an adstratum (co-existent) and not a substratum (influx of one over another), but also that there are Dravidian influences to be found in other IE language families as well. As is the case with all compelling AIT arguments, they’re well resolved even in an OIT scenario. Further, PIE theory is only that of descent. It looks at the IE language families and posits a common ancestor. It makes no comment on what happens to these families after descent. Saṃskṛta, as we have agreed, is not PIE itself. It’s a daughter language, and nothing prevents it from taking on influences from other languages after its birth, while its sisters moved out of the Indian homeland. 

Another example of reputationist deceit appears in the above case. Finno-Ugric languages have PIE loanwoards, but PIE does not have Finno-Ugric loanwords, yet this does not stop reputationists from positing the Steppe as the homeland. If this were true, then PIE should have Finno-Ugric loanwords, but the argument is used in the Dravidian case to exclude an Indian homeland. If PIE originated in/near/north of the Gangetic Plains, its split into daughter languages happened prior to its encounter with Dravidian languages. 

In any case, this confusion on loanwords and non-IE influences rests fundamentally on a chronology of PIE. Most linguists favour a period between the 4th-3rd millenniums BC for the split of PIE, but they express valid caution in being certain about when it originated or when exactly it split. In fact, while CL can define the internal chronology of languages, it’s not equipped to define absolute chronologies- which can only come through supplementary evidence from fields like archaeology. Further, the split was not a single event that created all IE groups instantly. Some insist that Anatolian is not a daughter of PIE but a sister, meaning that both PIE and Anatolian descend equally from a proto-Anatolian-PIE. Add to this the Nostratic hypothesis which speculates to the original Tower of Babel, the hypothetical proto-language from which descended all the major language families of humanity. New questions emerge instantly- who were the Nostratic people? Where was the homeland? What was their material culture like? How much of PIE culture and genetics was inherited from the Nostratic gene, similar to how we’re told of the Aryan gene bringing Indo-Aryan languages to India? When did Nostratic split into proto-Anatolian-PIE? 

Looked this way, the issue of language family origins and dispersals begins to look as contentious as that of hominid family origins and dispersals. The date of origin for our own species is consistently pushed back by newer findings. There is evidence that the Neanderthals too might have possessed language, and increasingly it looks like our family tree mated with theirs. Every new hominid fossil triggers a debate on whether it belongs to an ancestor species or to a sibling species. No neat chronology can be established from the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees, running through the many hominid species down to us, such that we know exactly when each species arose and was replaced by another (nor was the journey necessarily discrete). Neither are we clear on whether species that once diverged always remained so or whether they re-intertwined. 

The landscape is ever changing and increasingly complex, and if the linguistic family tree is indeed correlated to the genetic one then it’s bound to be equally uncertain. Pointing these facts out is not a denialism of evolution by natural selection, and thus it’s equally not a denial of the entire field of Comparative Linguistics. But reputationists like to portray that critique of their work is akin to dismissal of CL itself. 

More to the point, the AIT that we deal with in India is scarcely a linguistic theory alone. It has over the decades acquired ethnic, racial, cultural, genetic and archaeological layers, such that in its latest avatar the influx of particular type of DNA is taken as proof that all of Vedic culture, literature and language are a foreign import, and by extension everything under the umbrella of “Hinduism.” PIE originated in one part of the world and spread across Eurasia, but only in India do we find books with the title ‘Which of Us are Aryans.’ The problem is that language does not map congruently to ethnicity, race, culture or genetics. For example, the introduction of a new kind of potteryware in the archaeological record does not necessarily mean the arrival of a new language, and the converse is equally true. In India today, even within localised regions, we find several different languages, dialects and ethnicities coexisting in various degrees of overlap. In imagining PIE we must ask- would it have existed in isolation? Would it not have had other languages in its neighbourhood? Could the PIE homeland have been rich in other language families? 

A curious implication emerges from the correlation between languages and genetics. In the latter field, an area with the largest genetic diversity is considered the origin point for that genetic trait. In a very broad application, that Africa contains the maximum variety of great apes- humans, gorillas, chimps and bonobos- attests that it’s the origin of the great ape genus. This conclusion is based on the observation that the longer a trait survives in a region, the likelier it is to evolve mutations. Thus the longer that ancient apes survived in Africa, the more they diverged into different species. Applying this principle to IE languages reveals that of the 445 living IE languages today, 313 are of the Indo-Iranian branch (Iranian and Indo-Aryan). Should this not lead us to conclude that Indo-Iran was the original homeland? New research on the PIE in any case, led by Johanna Nichols, has brought the homeland to the Bactria Margiana Archeological Complex (BMAC), an area just north of Kashmir. Nichols is almost there, as we’ll shortly see. Igor Tonoyan-Belyayev argues that the BMAC was a secondary source of PIE dispersals, coming into prominence some time after the original center in India.<sup>10</sup> 

English dispersed across the globe and has become a primary language in India, but very few Indians have British genes. The religion and worldview of one tribe in the Middle East, in a few centuries, spread across the planet, but Arabian genes are not found in Muslims outside Arabia, nor is the expansion of Islam today accompanied by the dispersal of ethnic Saudi tribes. Chenghis Khan’s raid across Eurasia is said to have left his genes among many of us, and Mongols were lords of the land for a long time. But the Mongolian language does not exist today outside of a small tract of land wedged between Russia and China, and 50% of the current populace there follows a religion originated elsewhere (Buddhism). Mongols that conquered India are not even represented with Mongoloid features, their rulers acted out in Bollywood by the likes of Hrithik Roshan. When India acquired the culture of cricket it came with an internal terminology rooted in English, but that didn’t turn Indian genes British. Similarly, the spread of chess from India did not include the injection of Indian genes into all chess players. Language, culture and genes are inherited in the same way- from our parents. But they change and flow very different to each other. 

But AIT proponents wants us to believe that linguistics can tell us all of this. Theories on language origin and dispersal have been conflated with race, genetics and ethnicity, and circular logic is used to prove a priori narratives. An example of this comes from the case of Brahui, the language spoken by a Balochistani tribe of the same name. When it was discovered that Brahui is a part of the Dravidian language family, AIT proponents happily proclaimed this as clinching evidence of the standard AIT narrative- that IE speaking Aryan people invaded north India and the Harappan civilisation, forcing the latter’s Dravidian people into peninsular India (notice the implicit equation of language with ethnicity). Brahui was a remnant of that Dravidian populace, we were told. But linguists such as HH Hock and Joseph Elfenbein later showed that Brahui was the relic of a recent northward migration of Dravidian-speaking people, likely between 1000 and 1500 AD (other linguists continue to disagree, leaving it for us to decide how much weight to place in any linguistic conclusion). In other words, Brahui in Balochistan has nothing to do with Aryans of 1500 BC or earlier! It was only circular logic, a kind of fatal tautology, which allowed AIT proponents to take the evidence of Brahui and fit it into an a priori narrative. 

More recently this has been done with genetics. Much has been made about an influx of an R1a haplogroup in India after around 1500 BC. This lines up well with the a priori narrative of AIT- that Aryan people with Vedic languages and culture invaded India after 1500 BC (it may be called a migration but the result is the same). Viola! This R1a-Z93 is then equated to be a kind of Aryan gene, and its influx after 1500 BC is taken as proof of AIT. But as we will see, whoever the Aryans were, they were already indigenous to India in 3000 BC, so it could not have been them entering after 1500 BC. Further, Indian tradition records the influx of all kinds of Central Asian tribes- Kambojas, Hūṇas, Śākas, Yavanas, Uttarakurus and more after 1500 BC and especially in the 1st millennium BC. This R1a influx could as easily have been them, and genetic influx in itself tells us nothing about the language or culture of the people who brought it. To add to this, genetics now speculates that the R* macrofamily first originated in India and spread to Europe. Even if it originated elsewhere, its parent clade P* decidedly originated in India. What are we to make of that? Should this be used as proof that ancient Indians spread Saṃskṛta and Vedic beliefs across Eurasia? Of course not, for circular logic is just that, and genetic dispersals should not be conflated with linguistic or cultural ones. 

In fact, genetic data can neatly map onto any number of imagined scenarios. Take the example of a break in the genealogical record between the Ṛgvedic Pūru-Bhāratas and the Mahābhārata’s Kuru-Bhāratas. Very little information is available around Kuru, the Kaurava patriarch, and his descent from a Bhārata prince is wrapped in myth and mystery. If we date the Mahābhārata to somewhere in the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the Kuru dynasty’s founding dates to 2000-1900 BC. Tradition also informs us of the Uttarakurus, a tribe living north of Kashmir that Talageri equates to Tocharian. But the more common reading is Northern Kurus, while their connection to Indian Kurus is unclear. The Uttarakurus area roughly corresponds to the Russian regions east of the Urals. It could be imagined that the Kurus are migrant descendants of the Steppe Uttarakurus who enter India in 2000-1500 BC, and that they are composed primarily of elite male warriors. 

This (unsupported) imagination concedes to a kind of elite- dominance invasion- the Kuru bloodline is originally foreign to India, but establishes itself in major kingdoms and emerges as the primary dynasty. But it also shows that speculation can take many routes, and the same genetic data can be used to support any number of narratives. The foreign-Kurus fabrication allows for foreign cultural and technological aspects to enter India through them, and none of it need posit an AIT like scenario. Add to this theories on origin of the proto-Turkic people, which favour an origin near modern Xinjiang- Mongolia in the late 3rd millennium BC and a dispersal west in the following millennia. The genetic story of humanity is hardly complete, yet enthusiasm to tell India its history on the basis of a few genetic immigrations is curiously replete. 

On this note let’s acknowledge that we do in fact know what an Aryan invasion could look like, for we have the complete trail and record of this in Europe. The genetic composition and material culture in central Europe changed drastically in around the 4th-3rd millennia BC. Populations were replaced by newcomers from the east, bringing with them a new culture and physical type. This culture was the same as later found among Celts, Germans and Italics- indicating that it dispersed further into Europe. The current theory has these people emerging from the Yamnaya culture in the Pontic Steppe, and they have been equated to Aryans. Whether or not the last part is true, we know that when a small, primarily male, elite band invades a local, settled populace, then the signs are evident in material culture. 

In India, this is a rare case where the absence of evidence is indeed the evidence of absence, so consummate is said absence. Europe might not even have been invaded just once. From 4400 BC in Varna, Bulgaria have been found hundreds of graves which show stratification between the natives (at lower levels) and an intrusive elite (at higher levels). While nothing here indicates an invasion per se, it shows that Europe faced successive immigrations from the east that replaced existing populations and cultures. These elements are not found in the Indian subcontinent at all, and it explains why reputationists pounce on a genetic influx with an “I-told-you-so” desperation. 

The Yamnaya culture’s enduring association to PIE reflects Western civilisation’s search for its ethnic and linguistic genesis. Reputationist sophistry should not make us think that indigenism is unique to Indian thought. Close to 50% of European genes (on average) are comprised of the R1a haplogroup that spread there between 3000-2000 BC, and entered India in the late 2nd millennium BC. Even if scholarly circles work with dispassion, the European mind is still fascinated by the idea of horse-riding, meat-eating, well-built warrior classes invading from the Steppe and dominating the European landscape. Even now there’s a reluctance to consider that Yamnaya ancestors might have come from further east, that the true cradle of pre-Christian European culture, language and genetics could be in a country such as India. 

Unfortunately for this vision however, tracing upwards the family tree of R1a leads one to India. Archaeological migration patterns in Eurasia have a clear east-to-west direction. And on linguistic grounds Michel Danino’s critique stands unchallenged. After two centuries of work linguists have not been able to agree on a PIE homeland or nature of dispersal. Options are the Steppe, Anatolia, the BMAC and India. When we bring in additional evidence from text and archaeology the weight points overwhelmingly to India. But a final point about Comparative Linguistics and its relevance to understanding Indian history is captured by Sudarshan and Madhusudan in their paper The Science and Nescience of Comparative Linguistics,<sup>11</sup> where they assess the history of this discipline from various angles to conclude what we’ve seen examples of: 

> “A sober analysis of the field will highlight that much of the methods and conclusions are driven by selective data, arbitrary methods and flawed interpretations.” 

Even JP Mallory agrees- 

> “A solution to the IE problem will more than likely be as dependent on a re-examination of the methodology and terminology involved as much as on the actual data themselves.” 

What we have here then is a case of an Aryan Invasion, which under the lack of evidence was modified to a Migration, and in modern settings is the harmless dispersal of language and culture with innocent populations, based primarily on a field where critique argues a reassessment of the entire methodology and interpretations to begin with! It should be clear that rather than getting lost in AIT vs. AMT debates, we should settle for a single terminology and point instead to the absurdity of the entire narrative. In this paper we prefer Invasion since it better expresses what’s implied in any scenario- domineering foreign imports that have no evidence. 

#### Textual 

Fortunately for any researcher, textual analysis of the AIT problem suffices from the reading of a single book- the Ṛgveda. Unfortunately however, this is neither a book in a true sense nor in a language readily understandable. Further it is highly encoded, in that every word carries multiple meanings and entire verses can be interpreted from different schools of thought. For example, at one level the devas of Ṛgveda are personifications of natural phenomenon. This yields an interpretation of Ṛgvedic hymns as appeasements to the gods of nature. In another interpretation, devas are psychological phenomenon such that the same hymns are now internal calls to action, a drive to harness mental powers and direct them towards intended actions. Add to this the supremely vexing problem of Saṃskṛta itself. It has no alphabet case, no tangible way for us to differentiate between proper nouns, common nouns and adjectives. Take the word daurgaha. Daurgaha can be the name of a person, the name of a horse, a patronymic and also the property of being fast like a horse. Which meaning applies in which hymn, which interpretation to use for what verse? 

On the surface this may look like an insurmountable problem. But the truth is that all of the above interpretations are correct and none are wrong. The Ṛgveda has its primal position in Hindu canon not because it’s a random bunch of prayers to gods that later Indians did not even care for. It occupies that place because it’s a Rorschach device. Its composers used phonetics and language in way that wrapped multiple layers of meaning into the same syllables, making the Ṛgveda a kind of tesseract that reflects light at several different angles. Armed with a knowledge of metre and etymology, anyone in any age could gaze upon the Ṛgveda and find meaning relevant to their epoch. This is what made Ṛgvedic hymns magical, and their composers magicians or ṛṣis. 

A literal interpretation of the Ṛgveda is thus as valid as a metaphysical one, both different angles of light reflected from the same original monument of language. But when we search for proper nouns, names, tribes and places in the Ṛgveda we must remember that it’s not a historical document. It’s a collection of prayers important to the culture that engaged in them, framed in a perfected version of their native dialect. But it’s also the only text that can give us any information at all on the early Aryans, their living conditions, locales, friends and enemies, language, origins and fate. Further, the immaculate method of its preservation over the millennia has ensured that even in its current form it’s akin to a “tape-recording” of its era. This allows us to take the historical that we can find in it and assign to it a great degree of certainty. We may still summarise some inherent problems in extracting history from the Ṛgveda: 

1. **The supremely vexing nature of Saṃskṛta.** Ṛgvedic Saṃskṛta is archaic even compared to Pāṇini’s classical Saṃskṛta, and no two independent translations of the Ṛgveda have ever been the same. In a historical context, the problem is of differentiating between proper nouns, common nouns and adjectives. An example is in the Ṛgveda (RV) 7-33-14 (i.e., Book 7, Chapter 33, Verse 14) where we find the word pratṛdo. Griffith translated this as oh pratṛdas, while Jamison-Brereton (JB) read it as thrusting forth. Adding a piece of Paurāṇika genealogy to Griffith’s translation, Talageri understands pratṛdo as descendants of Pratardana (though the patronymic should be Prātardāneya). The difference comes from taking pratṛdo as a proper noun vs. an adjective. Who is correct, Griffith/Talageri or JB? Linguists, philologists, scholars and experts will tell us that they understand archaic Saṃskṛta well enough to know what the correct interpretation is. I disagree. The reality is ambiguous and points to the Ṛgveda’s multi-faceted nature. Historical readings are as correct as naturalistic or philosophical ones, though they rightly invite greater scrutiny. 

2. **Historicity of the Anukramaṇīs.** The Ṛgveda comes with a convenient index, a component in the mnemonic transmission of Vedic literature down the ages. For each of the 1,028 Ṛgvedic hymns the anukramanīs/indices give 1- the composer of each hymn or verse, 2- The deity that hymn/verse is addressed to and 3- The meter of that hymn. These indices lend themselves to a variety of historical and linguistic analysis, but they’re not considered part of the original text. This is debatable. Is the information contained in these indices part of the original tape- recording that was later compiled into anukramaṇīs? Or are the anukramaṇīs complete fabrications of a later era? Witzel<sup>12</sup> criticises Talageri for taking anukramaṇīs as historical, but he actually does accept their data (composers, deities, meters) as part of the original tape-recording! 

3. **Chronology of the Ṛgveda.** Despite decades of contrary evidence, Ṛgvedic chronology is stuck in a paradigm established by a scholar who disclaimed it himself prior to his death. Motivated by a historical and cultural paradigm revealed in the letters he wrote back home, Max Muller assigned an arbitrary date of 1200 BC as the terminus date for Ṛgvedic composition. He arrived at it by linear back-dating of Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad texts, and was bound by his own paradigms for how far back Indian history was allowed to go. Towards the end of his life he admitted that this was a working chronology, but the paradigm has remained essentially unchanged since. Reputationists accept that the Ṛgvedic people lived along the Sarasvatī but refuse to identify the Ghaggar-Hakra river system with Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī, because a significantly large body of scholarly work on Ṛgveda and Aryans is rendered quite useless when the implications of the Sarasvatī evidence is properly understood. 

Debates on the above issues are not settled. The reader must not take following conclusions as is simply because this paper says so. Neither is authority any reliability of evidence. Danino and Witzel are equally authoritative and credentialed in their fields, but while the former affirms Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī and expresses doubts on hypothetical PIE, the latter insists on the validity of PIE and is skeptical on Sarasvatī. Who is correct? The reader must decide basis their own journey to the truth. This context established, the first question we may ask of the Ṛgveda that has direct implications for AIT is this- where did its composers live? And the best answer to this comes from the 75th hymn in the 10th Book, called the Nadistuti Sūkta (Hymn in Praise of Rivers). Starting with the Gaṅgā, it moves westwards and lists the rivers of Vedic people such: Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Śutudrī, Paruṣṇī, Asiknī, Marudvṛdhā, Vitastā, Arjīkīyā, Suṣomā, Tṛṣṭamā, Susartū, Rasā, Śvetyā, Sindhu, Kubha, Gomatī, Krumū, Mehatnā. 

This list is in perfect order if we move west from the Gaṅgā, the only ambiguity coming from Sarasvatī, no longer a living river. Historians such as Irfan Habib have insisted that the Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī is the river Helmand (Haraxvati) of Afghanistan. There are two problems with this. For one, anyone claiming that the Helmand is Sarasvatī needs to explain why it’s listed in the Nadistuti Sūkta so out of order, when every other river is well placed on an east-to-west movement. AIT explains this by positing that the Aryans, on their way to north India, came upon the Helmand first, named it Sarasvatī, crossed a host of other rivers including the mighty Sindhu (which they just named ‘River’!) before reaching another river which they named Sarasvatī in memory of the Helmand. The history of AIT is littered with examples of special pleading, and this is one of them. 

A second problem in treating Helmand as Sarasvatī is how it breaks known linguistic connections. Sarasvatī stems from the root sarasa which itself is a compound of sa and rasa. In Avestan, the sa sound becomes the ha sound, which is why the Sindhu became Hindu (dha also becomes da in a loss of ‘aspirative’ sounds- a technicality we need not get into). If the Haraxvati was the original Sarasvatī, we should expect ha, raha and haraha to be similar roots in Avestan, but they are not. The full word sarasvatī only emerges from Saṃskṛta roots, and in Avestan those roots are divorced. For this and other reasons we can be certain that a population that knew the Indian Sarasvatī eventually migrated towards Afghanistan and, coming upon the Helmand, gave it a name to memorialise the river of its ancestors- not the other way around. Other evidence piles on here to make Helmand so untenable we need wonder why it was ever suggested- the Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī met the ocean, the Helmand does not! The Mahābhārata happens along a drying Sarasvatī and is decidedly around modern Haryana, distant Afghanistan known to it as Gāndhāra. 

The Sarasvatī evidence considered, the Nadistuti Sūkta alone is enough to show that the Ṛgvedic Aryans were native to north India. Supplement this with the fact that there’s absolutely nothing in the entire Vedic literature to indicate any migration from outside. If anything, combining the Vedic and Paurāṇika literatures suggests that the ancestors of the Vedic people (though not all Indians) came from eastern UP or Bihar. 

Textual analysis thus indicates that the Aryans we talk of had no memory of being foreign to India. This point needs elaboration, for across world history migratory populations have shown memory or evidence of said migration in their traditions. This is not necessarily conscious memory, but that extractable from their religion/culture/ myths- a point ignored by reputationists when they cite the example of European gypsies, who have no conscious memory of having migrated from India. Only in the case of Aryans in India would we have to plead that a group of people migrated from central Asia, retained their gods, motifs, archetypes and language, but forgot all about this trying journey by the time their descendants established themselves in north India. We should add here that in other cases- Greeks, Nordics, and more- memories of migration can be gleaned from their mythologies. In fact, even to the Greeks that came with Alexander, the first Dionysus (or patriarch) of their myths hailed from India! 

That the Ṛgvedic Aryans lived in India is not disputed even by reputationists, for the Aryan invasion occurs prior to the Ṛgveda. According to it the ancestors of those who composed the text lived outside India, and brought in both language and culture with them- which was crystallised in the Ṛgveda. So a question we can ask is- do we see a movement in the Ṛgveda? Given that it was composed over a few centuries we should see in it a west-to-east geography- in the earlier stages the composers should have been familiar with India’s northwest, and only later with central and eastern India. Is this what the text reveals? 

The Ṛgveda is a collection of 10 books, or maṇḍalas. Linguists, philologists, reputationists and revisionists are all in agreement over a broad periodisation of the Ṛgveda. The books 2-7, which are also called family maṇḍalas, represent an earlier period than the remaining books 1, 8, 9 and 10. There is no linear or discrete progression here. It’s not that that book 2 was composed, then 3, then 4 and so on. Instead the periodisation concludes, on basis of extensive structural study of the text, that the early books and later books are of relatively different periods. This is helpful for historical analysis, for example in the case of movement of the Aryans. If they did indeed come to India from the west, then in the early books we should see a western geography and no knowledge of the eastern geography. The eastern should come into horizon by the later books. 

Reputationists criticise such analysis using strawman arguments. For example, Witzel criticises Talageri for assuming a linear progression among the books, which the latter absolutely does not. Instead, Talageri uses the same broad periodisation that’s well accepted by reputationists themselves. This is what the analysis reveals: 

- Rivers in early books: Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, eastern tributaries of the Sindhu 
- Rivers in later books: Eastern and Western tributaries of the Sindhu 

The above is a broad simplification. For one, Witzel denies the presence of Gaṅgā in early Ṛgveda. This hinges on a disagreement on the meaning of Jahnāvī, which Witzel reads as daughter of Jahnu. Talageri retaliates that such a patronymic for a female is absent in all of Vedic literature, whereas the Jahnāvī is a known name for the Gaṅgā even in later times. What the analysis reveals is that in the early period the Ṛgvedic composers were familiar with the eastern geography of India, while the western sphere opened only in the later books. This analysis of early and later periods makes the evidence clinching. Talageri doesn’t stop here. He analyses all kinds of geographical data- animals, plants, trees to find that: 

- Eastern geographical references are distributed more or less evenly throughout the Ṛgveda, while, 
- Western geographical references appear only in the later books and are completely absent in the early ones. 

Unless one’s a reputationist, the textual evidence above is embarrassingly clinching- the Ṛgvedic people were unfamiliar with western geography in the early period, the very direction they supposedly came from! It’s why Koenraad Elst validly declares that Talageri has single-handedly won the AIT debate. Textual analysis should also define Aryan itself, for the word is derived from the Ṛgvedic Ārya as an anglicisation of it. Here the crucial facts are two- fold: 

- The word Ārya is used in the Ṛgveda only for members of the Pūru- Bharata tribe, never for anyone else even if an ally. 
- The word Ārya is used even for enemies, but only if they are Pūru- Bharata. 

In other words, Pūru-Bhāratas are the unmistakable Āryas of the Ṛgveda. And similarly in the Zend Avesta, Airya (lending itself to later Airan or Iran) is used as a self-appellation by the Kavi tribe. As the word for us vs. ‘them.’ There is an ethnic character here, for the Pūru-Bhāratas are a separate tribe from others, and they use Ārya only to define themselves. But equally do the Iranians use the term for ethnic self-designation. Even if we stick to mainstream narrative and imagine that Aryans came to India after 1500 BC, we would have to explain why only one specific tribe used the label for itself and not any other. If Pūrus, Druhyus, Ānavas and others all migrated to India together, why did the rest become non-Ārya? 

Understanding the contextual usage of Ārya in the Ṛgveda helps see the great fallacy in any Aryan invasion scenario. There never really were any people called Aryan who rode into north India on horse- pulled chariots and dislodged an urban civilisation. The idea came into existence and finds sustenance even today owing to the European search for its own glorious origins. Their modern languages compel them to accept a linguistic origin, the archaeological record shows a near domination of Corded Ware culture and descendants over ancient Europe, and genetics proves that much of European DNA can be traced back to the Steppe. Aryan is the great answer to these European questions. Racism and chauvinism ensured initially that the Aryan could never have been conceived as Indian, and reputationism in the modern era continues to deny the obvious. 

In the Ṛgveda we see that Vedic Saṃskṛta is a dialect of the Pūru-Bhāratas, while other tribes have somewhat different dialects such that they are called people with “bad-speech” or using “garbled speech.” Thus the Aryan Pūru-Bhāratas are already speakers of a PIE- descendant, and could not have been the PIE people themselves. Since the Pūru-Bhāratas are the Aryans, any people before them were at best proto-Aryans and not Aryans themselves. The Pūru-Bhāratas are indigenous to north India and have no memory of foreign ancestors. Their ancestors appear to have come from the Gangetic Plains to the Sarasvatī, only later moving towards the Sindhu. Any people that migrated/invaded India before their time can, by definition, have nothing to do with Ārya. We should keep such examples in mind when attempts are made to equate language with genetics or culture. 

The above alludes to a specific critique of Talageri’s Ṛgvedic analysis. His description of the Ṛgvedic pañcajana or five tribes- Yadu, Anu, Druhyu, Pūru, Turvaśa- as a PIE scenario and the assertion that Druhyu-Anu tribes are linguistic ancestors of IE language groups has been taken as a misunderstanding of the entire PIE landscape. Arnaud Fournet<sup>13</sup> alleges that Talageri, rather than accepting a PIE language and homeland, only imagines a pre-existing dispersed state of different PIE-descendant dialects that Talageri equates with Ṛgvedic tribes. The critique is entirely misplaced. Talageri takes the Ṛgveda as the only available evidence, and thus makes only the conclusions possible from within it. If the Ṛgveda, with its prime focus on Sudās and his dynasty, alludes to an already dispersed state then that isn’t the text or scholar’s fault. 

Instead, unless Talageri’s specific conclusions are refuted the implication of his interpretation places the PIE homeland (4000 BC – 3000 BC) at the Sindhu-Sarasvatī-Gangetic Plains, with extensive contacts to the north through modern Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Tibet. Talageri’s analysis in any case shows the PIE split to happen in modern Punjab and Haryana, but the PIE speakers hail originally from the Gaṅgā. But readers are encouraged to read original papers and studies and come to their own conclusions. Let not authority or secondary reference guide us in excavating true Indian history, which is but the history of our ancestors. 

Textual analysis of the Ṛgveda doesn’t stop here. An entire body of work has been created to analyse the material culture of the Ṛgvedic people in order to place them in time and to understand their relationship to PIE speaking people. This is a field rife with contention, prejudice, distortion and all kinds of aberrations that hinder honest, intellectual discovery. Sarasvatī itself gives us an example. The Ṛgvedic people are based around the Sarasvatī, it’s their primary river and is even deified as a goddess. They describe it as a perennial river, and tell us that it flows between the Yamunā to the east and the Indus’ eastern tributaries to the west. Geological surveys since the early 19th century, now supplemented by satellite data, have established the Ghaggar-Hakra river system as the erstwhile Sarasvatī. We know that the river did actually exist, and it dried up over a few phases such that by around the Mahābhārata era it disappeared into the desert. The AIT has Aryans arriving into India after 1500 BC, but if they knew the Sarasvatī as a bounteous river, how could they have arrived after it had already dried up? Some resolve this by the Sarasvatī = Helmand argument we’ve refuted earlier. The correct resolution is that the people of the Ṛgveda were in India long before 1500 BC. 

The Aryans arriving into India after 1500 BC paradigm is in any case an old hangover. So compelling is this paradigm that all theories of PIE origins work back from this date. If the Ṛgvedic Aryans were in India by 1500-1200 BC, then tracing their journey backwards we arrive at around 3000 BC as the date for their placement in the Pontic Steppe. Turning full circle in logic, any cultures found in central Asia at that time are then candidates for the original PIE culture! It’s accepted among scholars however, as we saw in the preceding section on linguistics, that PIE split somewhere in the 4th-3rd millenniums BC. This gives a linguistic hard date for when to place the PIE Aryans. 

Circular logic also makes people swoon at any genetic influx into India around this time and claim that the Aryan invasion has been scientifically proven (though they engage in sophistry and are sure not to call it Aryan or invasion). But a genetic influx is just a genetic influx, it carries no information on the language and culture of those people. Pots don’t speak, and neither do genes. Whoever these people were, we know that they could not have been Ṛgvedic Aryans who were already established in India in 3000 BC, when the Sarasvatī was the kind of river described in their prayers. A small point is to be made against the critique that Sarasvatī is described as a snow-fed river, while the modern Ghaggar-Hakra is a monsoon fed system. This really is a weak argument, flimsier even than the Helmand = Sarasvatī one. India’s northern rivers are both snow-fed and rain-fed, and while the primary ones descend from the mountains many tributaries are entirely rain-fed. The river system hinted by the modern Ghaggar-Hakra would have been elaborate with several criss- crossing streams that changed course every now and then. This kind of system benefits both from melted snow and rain. 

It’s telling that while the combined body of archeologists and geologists has no problem in identifying the Ghaggar-Hakra as Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī, resistance to this comes from reputationists of a linguistic origin alone. But why should linguistics reign supreme in the identification of a river system, when in the main it hasn’t even been intellectually honest about the Sarasvatī vs. Haraxvati debate? Another point to this is made by the evidence of iron, or the lack of it in the Ṛgveda. The Ṛgveda uses the word ayas which, though commonly translated to copper, could mean any metal in general. Yet it becomes clear that iron is not known to the Ṛgvedic people when only in later texts do we find kṛṣṇa ayas or iron. Ṛgvedic technology is decidedly pre-Iron Age, and Iron Age commenced in India sometime during the 2nd millennium BC. This again means that we must date the Ṛgvedic people to before that. But as is the case with Indian archaeology, dates are always being pushed back. Already we have evidence of iron in India even in 1600 BC, and meteoric iron has been found in Harappa dated to 2600 BC. We can be assured however that no amount of such evidence will ever be clinching for reputationists. 

Apart from material culture, we can look to the evidence of flora and fauna. It’s best to pick the animal that’s considered the greatest thorn in the OIT argument- the horse. The horse, or aśva, is considered the totem animal in the Ṛgveda, and from here it’s been equated as the animal-par-excellence of the Aryans- giving rise to imaginations of horse-pulled chariots descending into an unsuspecting Indus valley and uprooting its civilisation. Modern iterations of AIT avoid this line of argument, primarily because chariots entering into India has been archaeologically invalidated. But the horse argument remains enduring in the general public eye, so here are some details that emerge from text: 

- Aśva is not necessarily the true horse, equus caballus. It could be a generic name for equid that includes donkeys, onagers and mules- all of which are found in India. 
- Aśva is also used metaphorically to mean anything with great speed and mobility. It’s used once even to refer to a deer. 
- In a Ṛgvedic description of deities and their chariots, the chariot of the Aśvins (horse deities if Aśva = horse) is pulled by donkeys! 
- The real animal-par-excellence of the Ṛgveda is the cow, bos indicus and by extension the bull, vṛṣabha. Cow and bull motifs are found across the world, including in the Harappan civilisation. And the cow was evidently a staple of the common Indian household since the Mesolithic. 
- An archaeological point- true horse remains have been found in the Harappan civilisation. But true to their nature, reputationists dismiss/refute all non-linguistic arguments that destroy their linguistic hypothesis. Further, horses were found in the ancient world both in the regions of Afghanistan and Tibet- directly in the Indian neighbourhood. 

In other words, the entire equation ‘Ṛgvedic Aśva = Horse; no horses in India; thus Ṛgvedic Aryans foreign to India’ is utter disinformation. Not only have horse remains been found in India, the horse isn’t even as totem in the Ṛgveda as we’re led to believe. Similar contentions are found in the case of other animals- leopards, tigers, monkeys, elephants and more. But the holistic picture that emerges is that Ṛgvedic geography, material culture, flora and fauna are all indigenous to India. Witzel conducts similar analysis to arrive at the conclusion that the PIE homeland was of a temperate climate unlike that found in India, which we’ve addressed in the previous section. 

To sum up the textual evidence, no analysis of the Ṛgveda indicates that its composers were from outside India, or that they had any memory/knowledge of lands outside the Indian horizon. Analysis of internal evidence clearly shows an east-to-west movement prior to the Vedic period, from the Gangetic Plains to the Sarasvatī-Sindhu plains. Further, analysis of material culture reveals both the likely date for the Ṛgveda and its complete indigenity to Indian geography. A final point remains to be explored- Ṛgvedic Dāsas/Dasyus- the purported enemies of Ṛgvedic Aryans. This is crucial because the AIT rests on an Aryan vs. Non-Aryan platform. It assumes a necessary conflict between the invaders and the native, so textual analysis must address this conflict. We’ve seen how Ārya in the Ṛgveda refers exclusively to the Pūru-Bhāratas, whether enemy or ally, and never to any other even if they’re allies. These Āryas are in conflict with the Dāsas and Dasyus. 

AIT tells us that Dāsas and Dasyus are the indigenous people of India- the Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Language X speaking people that were displaced by IE speaking Aryans. This of course feeds into the divisive paradigms of brahmanical vs. Dalit; Aryan vs. Dravidian; foreign vs. indigenous etc. that mar honest narratives of Indian history. It’s telling that even Dr. Ambedkar rejected the idea that Dāsas were linguistically non-IE, and concluded (correctly) that they were in fact just other (linguistically) Ārya communities. If it’s not so, then in Dāsa and Dasyu names we should find Dravidian/Austric/ other influences. But that has not been the case. In fact the Ṛgvedic Dāsas are also IE people- primarily proto-Iranians. Avestan equivalents of Dāsa and Dasyu (Daha, Dahyu) are found in proto- Iranian personal names. The Dahae (Avestan Dāsa) were a prominent Iranian tribe even in Greek times, and where Dāsa is used in the Ṛgveda in a favourable sense it’s for Dāsas who conducted donor sacrifices. It’s contained in the name of Ṛgvedic kings such as Divodāsa (though not Sudās, which has a different etymology). The Ṛgveda does not use Dāsa for alien people completely different from the Pūru-Bhāratas. It uses Dāsa for its immediate neighbours to the west, the proto-Iranians, who also speak an IE dialect different from Vedic Saṃskṛta. Witzel uses the example of names such as Balbutha and Bṛbhu to argue for symbiosis between Aryan and some kind of non-Aryan culture. Far from being incompatible with OIT, this is well explained in Talageri’s theory, which has other IE language speakers as well as Dravidian/Austroasiatic speakers placed around the Ṛgvedic Āryas. 

This Ārya-Dāsa conflict is recorded even in Zoroastrian texts and reflected in the peculiar inversions of religion found therein. Ārya Devas become Iranian demons (Daiva) and Ārya Asura Medha becomes the Iranian god of light (Ahura Mazda). Āryas throw things into the fire, Dāsas don’t. Āryas worship Indra, Dāsas demonise him. Insofar as we want to find religious/ideological/ethnic conflicts in the Ṛgveda, we need not go further than the obvious. Āryas and Dāsas are both IE speaking people, descendants equally of those who spoke PIE. And the Dasyus are specifically Dāsa priests, like ṛṣis are for the Āryas. This is why the Ṛgveda reserves most of its animosity for Dasyus, while Dāsas are still spoken of favourably at times. Funnily enough, mapping this scenario to history confirms some suspicions of early AIT. The Harappan civilisation in some parts might have been peopled by Ānava (or proto-Iranian tribes, or Dāsas), and in the Ṛgveda they are in conflict with Bhāratas such as Divodāsa and Sudās. There were indeed battles between “Harappans” and “Aryans,” except these were political conflicts for control between native tribes of a common area- Indian ādivāsis all. 

On the count of Dravidian names, an interesting addenda here is the names of two late Ṛgvedic composers- Irimbiṭhi and Śirimbiṭha. Even to an untrained eye these feel more Dravidian than Sanskritic, and such is confirmed linguistically. If this doesn’t seem apparent, rendering them as Irimbidi and Shirimbidam might help. There is a town in Kerala named Irimbiliyam even today, and the Keralite community of Nambūdiri Brāhmaṇas preserve the most archaic form of Vedic practices. When looking for Dravidians in the Ṛgvedic age, we find them not among enemies but among composers. It bears reiteration that both Dravidian and Aryan are only linguistic terms. They do not map onto ethnicity or culture in the ways we’re led to believe. 

The above then is a summary of the textual situation. In this we have primarily looked at the textual reasons that make AIT untenable. The Ṛgvedic Aryans are firmly located in India and have no memory of a migration from outside whatsoever. Even if people lose such memories, their movements should reveal the direction. Internal analysis of the Ṛgveda shows that its composers moved from east to west. Even if the PIE homeland is outside India, it must be before the Gangetic Plains- the Tibetan Plateau for example. 

There is admittedly a bit of circular logic at play here. Once we establish the paradigm, based on a Preservation Principle and the weight of archaeological evidence, that the PIE homeland was in or near north India, then we can map any number of stories in Indian literature that support ‘dispersal scenarios’ for PIE or PIE descendants. Talageri equates this with the Ṛgvedic Battle of Ten Kings- the final dispersal event for PIE- but it’s the only mapping that has legitimacy. Talageri’s understood the profoundly linguistic nature of AIT. He realises that PIE homeland theories are linguistic at best, and that linguistic reputationists themselves insist that no other disciplines can correct or confirm their conclusions. As the only linguistically valid tape-recording of the past, the Ṛgveda is the only valid document for PIE-related analysis. And the picture it shows is indeed irrefutable and clinching. 

He is not alone in this. Shorn of reputationist agenda, when scholars approach the field with fresh eyes they frequently arrive at an out-of-India model. Recent examples of this are Alexander Semenenov and Igor Tonoyan-Belyayev, arriving from archaeology and linguistics respectively. Tonoyan-Belyayev (TB) uses a concept of ‘archaic periphery and innovative center.’ Under this principle, archaic linguistic elements travel to the periphery and, being placed furthest from the center of innovation, retain their original nature. The center of innovation on the other hand continues to develop new linguistic features, each of which disperse out in waves along previous dispersal routes. TB considers India to have been the original PIE innovation center, and in a later era the center shifted north/northwest to modern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. 

To him this dispersal happened along two traditional migratory routes. The western one, leading through Iran and Anatolia to Greece, he calls Western Silver/Lapis Lazuli route. The northern, headed via Afghanistan to Central Asia, was the Northern Birch/Cattle route. The first wave was between 3700-3300 BC, when proto-Anatolian and proto-Tocharian dispersed west and northwest respectively. The second dispersal was of proto-Italic, proto-Celtic and proto-Balto-Slavic between 3300-2800 BC, a period TB poetically names the Varuṇa-Dyaus-Prithvī period. The third migratory wave was during the classical Vedic period of Indra-Agni-Soma between 2600-1900 BC, which dispersed proto-Armenian, proto-Greek and proto-Thraco-Phrygian. At this point India lost its status as a center of innovation, though it retained its position as the original pool. A final wave of proto-IE language dispersals happened from the new center of innovation between 1900-1500 BC. 

TB’s work and Talageri’s are broadly in agreement with each other, though both arrive at their conclusions independently and from different backgrounds. The Ṛgvedic Aryans, who can conclusively be identified with Pūru-Bhāratas, are affirmedly indigenous to the Sarasvatī river system and have no memory of migration- nor should there be for a people who did not migrate from outside! Analysis also confirms that none of the Ārya-Dāsa or other conflicts indicated in the Ṛgveda point to any ethnic Aryan vs. Dravidian clash. A reasonable picture can be painted for the kind of PIE dispersal phases that linguists have always looked for, but ones that even Mallory- Adams concede have never been found conclusively. Within Indian history this part is problematic given the abundance of lore. Any number of eras/reigns/periods can be equated with PIE formation to dispersal scenarios. If done solely through the Ṛgveda then the answer stands evident. Unmistakably it emerges that between modern Tajikistan in the north to Haryana in the south, Afghanistan in the west to UP in the east lay the broad PIE homeland, where PIE existed likely between 3500-3500 BC and dispersed onwards from there. 

#### Archaeological 

Decades of work has failed to provide any evidence of an invasion into north India. Even any purported migration from the west has not been found in the archaeological record. Compare this with the situation in Europe, mentioned previously, where there are clear archaeological markers of invasion by a foreign population from the east. The origin of this population has been posited as the Pontic Steppe, but nothing precludes the Pontic people (or their language/ culture) from having originated further east. Even genetic evidence that talks of Steppe Pastoralists confesses that their own ancestry is unknown. 

Indian civilisation shows continuity from Mesolithic/Neolithic stages to Bronze and Iron Age cultures without a break in the record, accompanied by wholly indigenous development of agriculture and metallurgy. The archaeology veteran, BB Lal, who first associated the Painted Grey Ware culture with Aryans, later confessed this to be a false conclusion based on a priori narratives. He has since been at the forefront of establishing India’s deep archaeological continuity. The skeletal and cranial record in India does not show any break from at least 4500 BC. 

Archaeology has found horse remains and fire altars in the Harappan civilisation, which address some of the primary points AIT has clung to over the years. Again, evidence such as this is denied by reputationists. The Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), found north of India in Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan was considered Indo-Iranian by its original excavator. Further, genetics has shown that it was not a source of ancestry for Indians. This completely overturns the existing paradigm that BMAC was a stopping point for Indo-Iranians on their way from the Steppe, before their split and eventual entry into India and Iran. 

It’s now been proven that while bos indicus, the Indian cow, has no admixture of genes from bos taurus, the Taurine Cow of Europe, the converse is true. This means that the Indian cow went west, but no cows came east to India. To continue to plead AIT in this case means pleading that human migration was in opposite direction to domesticated cattle migration! Using Mallory-Adams’ terminology, it means that Neolithic PIE-people who were intimate with domesticated cattle brought not a single cow with them, and instead somehow chose horses as totem which they were only “somewhat familiar with.” 

Similarly the domestic mouse, associated with the advent and spread of agriculture, has been found to have originated in India. Tangentially, this implies that agriculture spread from India to the west and not the other way around. Or at least food grains did, for the domestic mouse follows grain storage facilities. 

Alexander Semenenko has shown that the vaunted horse-chariots of the Steppe cultures, once associated with Aryans, were in fact simple horse-drawn carts. Contrast this with the discovery of a true chariot in Sinauli, UP dated to at least 1900 BC- four centuries before the Aryans were said to have come to India. A fully-formed chariot in 1900 BC should anyway lead us to assume antecedents from at least a few centuries prior, so we know that horse-drawn carts would have been known in India 2300-1900 BC. 

Some archaeological limitations will always exist. We still need more DNA data from the Harappan civilisation, but finding it from the Gangetic Plains will be difficult given the ancient practice of cremation. The Gangetic Plains have been continuously inhabited for at least 10,000 years, and the ravages of time and monsoons have removed much of the ancient wood-based archaeological evidence. Even the palace of someone as late as Candragupta Maurya was said to have been made of wood, and is unlikely to ever be conclusively found. 

A final point can be made on the larger picture about migrations and invasions in general. History did not begin at 1500 BC, nor at 3000 BC nor even at 8000 BC. Humans have been living in Eurasia for many thousands of years, and the national borders of today were non existent. Through the Hindu Kush, via passes such as Khyber and Bolan, humanity has always travelled to and from India. North of Kashmir, passes through Tajikistan open the doors to east China and Central Asia. Long coastlines on either side have allowed Indian seamen to built great trading empires. Indian tradition holds memories of many groups migrating out of India, and later of Central Asians coming in large numbers. For the Harappan civilisation that matures by 2500 BC, we now have antecedents in the form of pre-Harappan cultures, indicating that it did not evolve out of a vacuum. All of this tells us that of course humans could have migrated to and from India in 1500 BC, in 3000 BC, or before, and that surely this did not happen just once. 

Denying the AIT does not mean denying human migration itself, nor does it mean denying that a PIE language existed. Specifically, denying AIT means denying the foreign origin of Saṃskṛta and Vedic culture on the basis of textual, linguistic and archaeological evidence. Further, using all of these a robust out-of-India case can be built, and in its full form it has yet to be disproven even as its acceptance in academic circles is hindered by a mix of naive Hindu traditionalism and rabid Hinduphobia, with a destructive feedback loop between them creating impenetrable echo chambers. As a complete theory of Indo-European origins, OIT has implications for all of humanity. But in the Indian context all we do is prove that the people who called themselves Ārya and composed the Ṛgveda were wholly indigenous to India. Beyond that, if it is proven tomorrow that proto-PIE speakers migrated to India, say in 8000 BC, it would have no bearing on Vedic and Saṃskṛta indigenity whatsoever. 

There is also the matter of the Nostratic language theory which opens up a new layer of questions on human cultures, origins and migrations. Nostratic doesn’t have broad scholarly consensus, but it has indeed put together more than 200 root words that are common to the descendant languages. Dated to the 7-6th millennia BC, the language is placed usually around the Fertile Crescent, and Indian tradition could have answers here too. We could speculate that the era of Pṛthu Vainya in ~6500 BC represents the chief Nostratic dispersal event. This is of course pure speculation, but it indicates that the larger story of human languages and families is far from closed. 

This is easy to see when we shed modern reductions of the ancient civilisational world. Evidence mounts that the ancient humans were more civilised and connected than we give them credit for, and Dravidian and Austroasiatic languages could have a deep history of maritime dispersals and cultural diffusals. We are yet to scratch at the surface of these things, but we can be certain that the culture represented by Vedic literature was born on the Sarasvatī, was wholly indigenous to the land around it and can be reasonably dated in time. The larger PIE sprachbund, or language area, could have spanned an area ranging to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the north and Iran in the east, putting it in the neighbourhood of a variety of different cultures and language families. Similar attempts are done with the Dravidian language family, where evidence of it in modern Balochistan or Iraq is used to posit an outside-India origin for it. This too ignores all evidence of Dravidian’s deep roots in the Indian subcontinent. When it comes to India, it seems that our history is only that of what invaded/migrated/trickled in, and to even suggest an opposite direction is both revisionism and chauvinism! This when genetically India is emerging as humanity’s second primordial homeland, outside of Africa. 

Archaeological and textual evidence on the AIT table is also brought by Avestan and Mitanni. The Zend Avesta is the primary document of Zoroastrians, and Avestan language is considered a near dialect to Vedic Saṃskṛta. Attested in inscriptions in the Middle East in 1500 BC, Mitanni evidences the presence of Indo-Aryans there from at least 1900 BC. Here the work of Talageri has quite irrefutably won the debate, but mainstream scholarship tends to side-step his evidence. The primary narrative of the Indian-Iranian-Mitanni connection is that PIE-speakers dispersed from their original homeland, reached Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent where the Mitanni and their descendants split up, proceeded towards Iran where the Iranian language split, and finally reached India where manifested the Indo-Aryan language family. 

We must understand the necessary implications of this interpretation, which stand refuted when Ṛgvedic internal chronology is considered. The implication is that in the earliest layers of the Ṛgveda we must find the most common elements between Indo-Aryan, Mitanni and Iranian. Whatever was shared between these cultures must by definition fade over time, such that its incidence in the Ṛgveda should be descending. What does Ṛgvedic internal chronology suggest? 

Talageri has analysed the incidence of linguistic indicators, i.e. of names and geography, to show that Ṛgvedic internal chronology paints an entirely different picture than mainstream conjecture. Common elements with Mitanni, such as name suffixes –aśva, -ratha, -sen and prefixes bṛhad-, sapta- and abhi- are found exclusively in the later books and are completely absent in the early books. Similar is the case when common elements with Zend Avesta are considered, including the consideration of meters. If the PIE people originated outside India, split towards Mitanni first, Iranian second and finally to Indo-Aryan, then we should find common elements between these cultures in the earliest layers of the Ṛgveda. Instead we find an opposite scenario. Names and geography that share common elements are found in the later books of the Ṛgveda, indicating that the split happened near the Sarasvatī valley. 

This approach is criticised on some extremely flimsy grounds that evade the primary implications it asserts. Fournaut reminds us that names carry through the ages, and that names in any age can be rendered into a singular linguistic style. This is true and salient for an absolute chronology of the Ṛgveda. But Talageri’s analysis relies on its internal chronology, which is well established among scholars. The chronological division between early and later books is not his imagination, and if particular naming styles, suffixes and prefixes exist only in one division but not the other, then it gives us relevant historical information. If common elements with Mitanni and Avestan are found only in the later books, we’re forced to accept that in the early period these linguistic groups were unseparated. 

As previously mentioned, Witzel criticises Talageri’s analysis on the strawman grounds that it takes a chronology of the maṇḍalas as linear progression. For one, Talageri does not do this. But secondly, Witzel’s intellectual dishonesty is curiously problematic. He criticises Talageri’s reliance on anukramaṇīs when 1- he accepts that their data is part of the original Ṛgvedic tape-recording and 2- the anukramaṇīs are not salient to Talageri’s conclusions from internal chronology. In fact, the typical reputationist playbook that Witzel uses against any kind of out-of-India scenario is this: 

1. Begin with discrediting the agenda. So such works are first declared indigenist or revisionist to imply that objectivity is compromised. 
2. Discredit the author of that work. So Talageri is just a bank clerk who does not understand linguistics. Koenraad Elst’s understanding of philology is poor, and Nicholas Kazanas did not properly understand PIE reconstructions. 
3. Engage in pedantic undermining, so that it becomes more pertinent whether we call it “Slavic,” “Slavonic” or “Balto-Slavic” than what the relevant conclusions are. 
4. As a corollary of the above, establish one’s own supreme and complete expertise of the linguistic field. 
5. Nitpick or make strawman arguments that ignore the real points. So Talageri is criticised for using anukramaṇīs (though their data is accepted to be a part of the Ṛgveda) and Kazanas for misunderstanding Saptasaindhava. But no refutation is given of Talageri’s analysis through internal chronology, or of Kazanas’ Preservation Principle. 
6. Deny/dismiss/refute all non-linguistic arguments such as horses, fire-altars, Sarasvatī. The reputationist suddenly understands archaeology, geology and equid anthropology better than experts of those fields, all the while dismissing those who (allegedly) do not comprehend his own. 
7. Falsify data, which Witzel did do in a notorious case of “Amāvasu went west.”<sup>14</sup> He accepted it as an innocent error when challenged. Of course, when revisionists make errors it’s due to their agenda. When reputationists do they’re inadvertent. Witzel also claims that RV 7-33-1 to 7-33-3 indicate that Vasiṣṭha crossed the Sindhu from the west- thus indicating that he was a migrant into India. But anyone can check this. These verses are, figuratively, uttered by Indra. He says that Vasiṣṭha invited him here, across the Sindhu. 

But sindhu is used here in a general sense as river, and the river in question is later clarified as Yamunā. There are in fact no references to Sindhu in all of maṇḍala 7, and in any case it’s Indra who appears the migrant. Why would this not be used to support AIT instead, that Indra was a migrant into India? Doing so would have to refute Kazanas’ principle and explain why Indra hasn’t been preserved in his homelands. 

Having considered all the above, the story of AIT- which occupies a fixed point in time and can be explored linguistically, textually and archaeologically- deserves to be discarded. But a final word is called for by a relatively new entrant to the scene- genetics. 

#### Genetic 

As a field of hard, scientific data, genetics stands alone. To project it on history we need to provide a robust base built on textual, archaeological and linguistic evidence. The AIT in its current form is the Indian implication of a linguistically accepted theory on the PIE homeland. But AIT has no textual or archaeological evidence, and linguistic analysis along a Preservation Principle can argue for an Indian origin of PIE. There are and can be many arguments in this field, but between genetics and the AIT there is strictly no connection. Language and genes may originate the same way- through fact of who we are born to- but they evolve and disperse very differently. Genetic analysis of a thousand years from now cannot reveal what language you spoke at your deathbed. It can only supplement a contextual base of your life- where you lived, when, who your parents were, whether you left any writings behind, etc. These facts understood, in a paper titled The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central Asia,<sup>15</sup> the genetic diversity of India has been shown to be composed of three genetic groups: 

1. First Indians- A band of humans that arrived from Africa 65,000 years ago. 
2. Second Indians- A second band that arrived somewhere around 7000 BC. 
3. Third Indians- A primarily male population that arrived in the 2nd millennium BC. 

There are conceptual problems in the paper’s terminology, which equates genetics with cultural lifestyles to an unsubstantiated degree. For example, the third Indians are named “Steppe Pastoralists” on the common assumption of the Yamnaya Culture as the PIE homeland. But the researchers concede that the path by which this ancestry arrived in India is uncertain. Further, the researchers admit that the location of the initial formation of Yamnaya ancestry is uncertain. In other words, all we know is that some people arrived in India in the 2nd millennium BC, we know neither that they were pastoralists nor that they truly came from the Steppe! Genetic data here has clearly been fit to an existing paradigm on PIE origins and AIT.

We’re fortunate that the researchers found no evidence of a BMAC ancestry in Indian genetics, for such an occurrence would surely have been taken as confirmation of the theory that Indo-Iranians stopped at BMAC for a few generations before splitting up and proceeding to India and Iran. When we understand the terminology this way we can see why it’s better to talk of genetics as genetics alone, unless it has true supplements in fundamental fields. For example, Indian literature will readily attest to an influx of primarily male populations from central Asia in the 2nd and 1st millenniums BC. It will relate how these populations merged with local culture and language and were completely Indianised, explaining the lack of archaeological evidence. It also makes obvious that this influx was directed towards India and not Iran, which explains why this “Yamnaya ancestry” is not found in Iranian populations (which it should be if it were truly migrating Aryans). 

In the context of AIT this third band of Indians is the problematic point, for it’s equated with the arrival of Aryans into India. But we understand by now that any attempt to equate genetics with language is fraught with issues. Under extreme critique it harks to race science, now discarded as a legitimate field. But genes are real while races were not, so this does give genetics greater weight. Yet when genetics is mapped to language and culture it does essentially the same thing that racism does, especially because it does so under a priori narratives. Only when equipped with a prior narrative for the arrival of Central Asians in India in the 2nd millennium (bringing Saṃskṛta and the Vedas) would one equate a genetic influx with it. A true examination reveals Saṃskṛta and the Ṛgveda to be indigenous to India in 2500 BC, and make such equations immediately untenable. Only a prejudice to find Dravidians in Dāsas and invaders in Āryas equates the Second Indians with Harappans and Third Indians with Aryans. Honest research shows the utter vacuity of an Aryan vs. Dravidian clash on all counts- textual, linguistic, and archaeological. Similar reasons make other terminology like Ancestral North Indians and Ancestral South Indians distasteful, giving unnecessary colour to the genetic truths that do exist. 

Notice also the other inconsistencies in such a conclusion. The Steppe Pastoralists went to Europe first, in 3000 BC, where their ancestry can be found today to be >50%. The people then came to India after 2000 BC and the ancestry here is less than 25%. Where the genes went the most, language is attested later and culture is non-existent. Where the genes went the least, language is attested earlier and the culture appears in full bloom. Do we need any other evidence to delink genetics, language and culture? 

These points alone should preclude further discussion into yDNA, mtDNA or haplogroups. Not because this isn’t science, or because it tells us nothing about the story of humanity. But because when discussing a purely linguistic theory and its application to India in the absence of any textual or archaeological evidence, whatever we search for will not be found in genetics. We started this paper by explaining that AIT is the Indian implication of a larger linguistic theory on the PIE homeland. For readers interested to know more about existing PIE homeland theories, Maria Gimbutas’s Kurgan hypothesis and Colin Renfrew’s Anatolian agriculture hypothesis are narratives to look at. The first has the Pontic Steppe as the PIE homeland, while the latter places it in Anatolia and links language dispersal with the spread of agriculture. The Pontic Steppe is an untenable homeland for a variety of reasons discussed above. With the discovery of indigenously developed agriculture in the Indian subcontinent, the transmission of agriculture from Anatolia/Iran also has no archaeological support. These are simple reductions of important theories, but they articulate primary reasons why they’re incompatible with Indian history. Colin Renfrew has indeed agreed that there seems to be no reason to consider the Harappan and the Vedic as mutually exclusive cultures. We thus conclude with a quote from him which summarises what this paper seeks to establish: 

> “When Wheeler speaks of the Aryan invasion of the Land of Seven Rivers, he has no warranty at all, so far as I can see. If one checks the dozen references in the Ṛgveda to the seven rivers, there is nothing in any of them that to me implies an invasion. Despite Wheeler’s comments, it is difficult to see what is particularly non-Aryan about the Indus Valley.” 

#### True Aryan History 

While linguists such as Mallory-Adams concede that no certainties can be assigned regarding the PIE homeland, we must consider the psychological reason why out-of-India theories appear distasteful or motivated. 

Of all possible locations for the PIE homeland, India is the only place where the posited source culture survives. Anatolian homeland theories have no modern Anatolians to speak on their behalf. Ancient horse-riders from the Pontic Steppe do not appear on the academic landscape to argue for a Steppe homeland. When Maria Gimbutas speaks of the Kurgan hypothesis or Colin Renfrew of Anatolian origins we are a priori assured that there’s no nationalism and/or chauvinism at play. Only in the case of India, owed to the continuity of its civilisation, can there be Indians still following some kind of Aryan culture and arguing for an Indian homeland- both. Modern sensibilities are obviously alerted to subjectivity and bias. When a Shrikant Talageri or Subhash Kak speak of Indian origins to PIE we are conditioned to suspect mischief. But for a Talageri there’s an Elst, for a Kak there’s Kazanas, Frawley and Semenenko, and before a Muller was a Voltaire. Why do these people place the homeland in India, in all violation of the principle that the homeland is usually near the author’s native land? 

When we look beyond this filter and consider the Indian- homeland scenario with an open mind, we find little that actually refutes it linguistically and a whole lot that affirms it archaeologically and textually. As was previously detailed, some linguists now think Anatolian was a sister language to PIE, and before proto-Anatolian- PIE existed Nostratic. Remarkably alike to how we talk of hominid species, we can talk of language families and evolution only in broad periods with no possible hard dates for the birth/split of lineages. Talageri’s analysis is correct because it takes the Ṛgvedic picture as it appears- various IE-speaking tribes in a state of conflict, which in phases triggers outward migrations. Of course, as is suggested by linguistic family trees, the ancestors of these people would have spoken PIE. But that the Ṛgveda shows a post-PIE state is not Talageri’s fault. What the reputationists cannot digest is Talageri’s conclusions from internal chronology- that the Ṛgvedic people moved east-to-west, implying that the hypothesised PIE homeland is to the east of Sarasvatī, not to its west. While there is no consensus on precise timelines or waves, three broad dispersal events/periods are accepted for PIE: 

1. **Dispersal of Anatolian and Tocharian,** in that order. But Anatolian likely dispersed much earlier, such that some linguists think it was sister to PIE and not daughter. Remember- we do not really know when PIE became Anatolian. Did Anatolian arise at the PIE homeland and migrate to its geographically attested location, did PIE migrate there and birth Anatolian, or did Anatolian originate somewhere between the home and final lands? Answers to this are not at all neat for any language. 

2. **Dispersal of Italic, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and Slavic.** This implies that after Anatolian and Tocharian separated from PIE it continued to evolve for a period of time before these family groups originated. The PIE that Anatolian dispersed from is obviously very different to the PIE these languages disperse from. 

3. **Dispersal of Albanian, Greek, Armenian, Iranian and Indo- Aryan.** Again implying that PIE continued to evolve after previous families separated. Clearly after the previous dispersals we must speak of a kind of post-PIE, because it’s not the PIE that Anatolian separated from. And what happened to PIE after this stage? Once all language families were birthed, where did PIE itself go? 

This last point is important on the Aryan question. PIE was preceded by a mother language of some kind, would have existed alongside sister languages, and interacted with foreign languages. Why do we assume that all of PIE-related culture and religion originated within a single window of time, under PIE speaking people? The PIE cultural kit obviously would have inherited a lot from its mother and evolved through interactions with sisters and foreigners. Part of PIE culture thus originated from somewhere outside the PIE homeland- wherever the homeland of its mother was. The mother’s culture in turn inherited elements from the grandmother’s homeland. Linguists are right when they tell us that the PIE theory is scientifically correct. They self-aggrandise when they insist that this science can tell us everything about people, culture, religions, lifestyles, practices and migrations. 

The best that any PIE homeland scenario can linguistically posit is a situation that offers compatible dispersal events, and both Talageri and Tonoyan-Belyayev articulate this out of India with great detail. The placement of PIE daughters in the PIE homeland before their dispersal is not a negation of the linguistic hypothesis like Fournet considers it to be. The true PIE story is that its homeland covered modern Pakistan, eastern Iran, Afghanistan and northern India. Given the range of PIE lexicon that Mallory-Adams detail on flora, fauna, climate and geography we must assume that the PIE homeland covered a wide base. The lexicon suggests a Neolithic population that’s familiar with agriculture, animal husbandry, settled living in wattle- and-daub structures, as well as semi-nomadic and pre-rural cultural states. 

PIE chronologies are thrown into disarray when archaeological evidence is considered. In Anatolia as well as Indo-Iran, the Neolithic transition to animal husbandry and agriculture is evidenced in the 7th and 6th millenniums BC. Does this indicate that PIE was spoken then? Or was it pre-PIE? Or pre-Anatolian-PIE? Or Nostratic as some linguists propose? Should we really let linguists and hypothesised languages dictate all history? If we do, why is it that no German, French or Italic book exists with the title ‘Which of Us are Aryans’? The reality is that even if we point to one location on the map and call it the PIE homeland, linguistics cannot conclusively say that PIE did not exist at that time in any neighbouring location. Before Indo- Aryan is pre-Indo-Iranian, before which is PIE, preceded by pre- Anatolian-PIE, and before that a Nostratic in the hypothesised family tree. 

The gravitational center of languages thus has shifted over time, across the spans of human inhabitation. In a broad correlation with genetic movements, languages have followed human migrations and evolved in a multi-faceted wave-like manner. There might have been a time when human tribes migrated from the Fertile Crescent to the Indian subcontinent, a time when the converse happened, and periods where both happened simultaneously. Some journeys would have made a lasting linguistic and genetic impact while others not. Colin Renfrew’s Anatolian hypothesis places PIE in around 7000 BC, while the Nostratic theory championed by Allan Bomhard places Nostratic around the same time in the same location. PIE experts place its split in around 3500 BC, long after Renfrew’s suggestion. When we see these problems resolved by positing pre-languages and post-languages of all degrees hypothetical, we must realise that history is not the domain of linguistics. 

Reputationists criticise this line of attack. They believe pointing out to uncertainties and inner debates in the field is akin to dismissing the field, which is clearly not the case. Any number of debates abound in physics regarding the origin of our universe, and the 2020 Nobel physics laureate Roger Penrose has speculated that there was something before the Big Bang. This allows us to be skeptical of current physics’ models of origin, but that does not mean we dismiss physics entirely. Such is the case with linguistics as well. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is not the revisionist’s playbook at all but the reputationists’, which is why the Purāṇas are never brought to bear on Indian history by them. 

In the case of India we know that agriculture and animal husbandry are indigenous. We know also that it was, as it still is, a demographic heavyweight throughout history. Historically recent incursions into India by Scythians, Greeks, Hunas, Mongols and Turks overshadow the weighty record of population groups migrating out from the fertile and populated Sindhu-Sarasvatī-Gaṅgā plains in prehistory. Indian tradition readily attests to the flow of nomadic populations throughout the 8th-4th millenniums BC. Any number of these scenarios lend themselves to Nostratic and PIE homeland speculations. 

We must therefore focus on the primary meaning of Ārya and the implication of AIT- that Vedic culture and Saṃskṛta were foreign imports into India. If our focus reveals an out-of-India PIE scenario then so be it. Of all the Eurasian probables for a PIE homeland, India happens to be the only one supported by a mounting body of archaeological and textual evidence. All of PIE flora, fauna and geography are compatible with valid Saṃskṛta words, and PIE climate, material culture and kinship are compatible with parts of India in 7000-3000 BC. 

Saṃskṛta is thus indigenous to this land. Even if its ancestor came from abroad, over a longer period that ancestor was anyway varyingly proto-Indo-European, proto-Anatolian-PIE, Nostratic or a yet to by hypothesised pre/post-something. And given that we talk of several millennia, linguistic gravitational and dispersal centers would have obviously shifted. The linguistic event horizon itself does not go beyond the last 10,000 odd years, prior to which no reasonable linguistic hypothesis is possible. But that language, culture, ethnicity and genetics have far deeper routes should be obvious to all. Funnily enough, the historical landscape beyond the linguistic horizon, which is now being revealed by genetics, finds echoes in the Indian tradition academia has always ignored- the Purāṇas. 

The Ṛgvedic evidence is of course unmistakable. The people who composed Ṛgvedic hymns lived near the Sarasvatī’s banks, which correspond roughly to modern Delhi, Haryana and western UP including parts of Punjab and Rajasthan at the periphery. Even if we imagine that their ancestors once roamed the Steppe (we have no evidence to do so) the concepts, ideas and events expressed in the Ṛgveda decidedly happen within this geography. And these are the people, along with proto-Iranians, who call themselves Aryans. Maybe they carry ancestry of some “Iranian Agriculturalists” from 7000 BC. Maybe they have other genetic strains yet to be discovered. They spoke a form of archaic Saṃskṛta which originated in this land, though of course this Saṃskṛta was the post-something of a pre- something-language. 

Whether it was spoken in 1500 BC or 3000 BC, Saṃskṛta was obviously very different from its ancestor language spoken even 500 years before that. Maybe that ancestor language came from elsewhere, or maybe its mother or daughter did. Maybe a single Central Asian tribe of shepherds in 8000 BC interned in the Kabul valley one season and transferred the entire cultural kit to early Daitya-Āditya tribes! But war chariots were not introduced to India from outside. Horse species of all kinds are located peripheral to the greater Indian subcontinent, including the true horse. Fire altars are attested in India long before the arrival of any “Aryans” in the 2nd millennium BC. So whether it was through the Z93 R1a haplogroup, through a single Afghan tribe interning in the winter, or through a trickle of Central Asian tribes migrating over centuries- what exactly in Vedic and Indian culture did they bring from outside, and why should we think of them as Aryan in any sense? 

Indians moved from nomadic to settled states without significant invasions or migrations from abroad, and while all kinds of cultural, genetic and linguistic exchange can be found the language, culture and worldview evidenced among Aryans- people of the Ṛgveda- is undoubtedly homegrown. There was never an invasion. No migrations. Many ‘singular tribes’ who interned but not the transfer of an Aryan kit from abroad. No foreign Aryans who pushed southwards an urban Dravidian populace. No male elite dominance that defined Indian religion and social organisation for millennia to come. No usurping of indigenous property rights by a foreign populace. The Aryans were Indians. They were your ancestors and mine. Tamil is my heritage and Saṃskṛta yours, and the reverse is equally true. The tiniest goddess-idol on an isolated Andamanese island is our culture as much as the greatest myth of Indra is. This in fact is the true Aryan history. 

A final point is driven home by considering the term Drāviḍa. Quite like the word ārya it never had any racial connotations. Further, while Ārya was still a kind of ethnic denomination among some tribes, Drāviḍa was purely a geographic one. In their paper The A of ABC of Indian Chronology,<sup>16</sup> Manogna Sastry and Megh Kalyanasundaram compile Ārya and Drāviḍa as they occur in Indian texts. It’s not surprising that in a survey of Indo-Aryan texts the ratio of Ārya to Drāviḍa is more than 10:1. What’s clinching is that in the oldest surviving works of Tamil literature- Ezhuttadikaram, Solladikaram and Poruladikaram- not a single instance of the word Drāviḍa is found! So much for Aryans vs. Dravidians. 

#### A Note on the Paper’s Title

Witzel’s notorious “rebuttal” to Talageri came in the form of condescension, evident from the title containing ‘incredible wanderlust.’ Right off the bat, Witzel seeks to show how ridiculous Talageri’s proposition is. He suggests, sarcastically, that for it to be true, the Ṛgvedic tribes must have possessed an incredible wanderlust! It’s a great example of Western scholarship’s a priori disdain for traditional Indian narratives, for look how ridiculous Witzel’s position actually is:

- Were the proto-Indo-Europeans already not possessed with an incredible wanderlust? If not, what propelled them to spread from a central spot in Eurasia to two ends of it? If there can be other factors than “wanderlust,” what makes Witzel project wanderlust exclusively onto the prospect of migrants out of India?

- Mainstream narratives point to several migrations into India by Central Asian tribes. Are we allowed to lampoon this proposition, simply by cynically pointing to an imagined “wanderlust” in the Steppe? If not, why are words and notions that suffice to dismiss “indigenist” models not equivalently enough to dismiss reputationist models?

- And what of Indian narratives, which speak/know of migrations out of India beginning from the 1st manvantara itself, with Priyavrata the elder son of Svāyambhuva Manu?

- And what of genetic evidence that shows prehistoric India to have been humanity’s second primordial homeland, outside of Africa? Clearly prehistoric Indians possessed a “wanderlust.”

For these reasons I elect to lampoon Witzel’s title in turn, and reaffirm the ancient and enduring Bhāratīya wanderlust. Yes, we had it. Yes, our sons and daughters reached your lands and conquered you- in a manner of speaking. Go ahead, take your time trying to come to terms with this. Till then, despite Koenraad Elst’s dismay<sup>17</sup> at the Hindu apathy towards the larger PIE/IE debate, we can’t actually bring ourselves to care. This, more than anything else, explains even the ignorant Hindu’s dismissal of AIT. It simply doesn’t matter, though if it does, we have enough evidence in our armoury.
