# fractal maṇḍala

is a digital garden to chronicle what I learn and build. I develop web products, create historical fiction worlds, dabble in psytrance production and write essays on Indian history and civilizational consciousness.

Beginning 2023, I have been scaffolding my way in web-dev using a range of online tutorials, and a healthy usage of chatGPT. I'm loving Sveltekit, and that's my select framework for this site. I haven't really tried SCSS, but I use original SASS because I like not having to use curly braces.
